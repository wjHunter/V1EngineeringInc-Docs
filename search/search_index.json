Since day one I have never encouraged endstops be used, until now. The Mostly Printed CNC and LowRider CNC are unique in the fact that two of the axes are powered at each end of the axis. Using this fact and the new dual endstop firmware we can now more precisely and accurately set the position of every single stepper on the machine independently. This should reliably give you repeat-ability on the order of your endstops resolution, even after powering off. Before this new firmware update all the machines in this category relied 100% on the users build accuracy, or manual measuring. This involves setting of each axis before engaging the steppers and locking it in place. If the steppers are ever disengaged during use only the side of the axis with an endstop can accurately be accounted for. This makes fixturing, tool changes, and multi-day jobs extremely difficult to get repeatable results. A poor build or lack of axis alignment before each job will result in a non-square skewed axis. A skewed axis will result in ovals and parallelograms instead of circles and 90\u00b0 cornered rectangles. Changes in build accuracy due to use and environmental conditions need to be adjusted out or accounted for manually. Now just a minor offset adjustment will correct this. Plugging In The Steppers \u00b6 Marlin\u2019s extruders=0 or remapping of pins is used in the firmware to allow the use of all the control boards drivers. The unused extruder driver/s are used for the extra stepper/s. SKR Pro \u00b6 If the firmware is set for EXTRUDERS=0 then E0 becomes X1 and E1 becomes Y2. (or LR would be E0=Y2 E1=Z2) RAMBo \u00b6 Ramps \u00b6 Mini-RAMBo \u00b6 This board only has 4 drivers available and can easily be used with the LowRider CNC but cannot full take advantage of the new firmware with the MPCNC. Archim \u00b6 Endstops \u00b6 The min pins are used as normal for the first stepper and the max pins are used for the second stepper on that axis (X2, Y2, Z2), still as a min. For example, X1 pairs with Xmin, X2 pairs with Xmax. DO NOT USE THE + (positive) Terminal. S & \u2013 (signal and Negative) Only Xmin=X1 limit switch Xmax=X2 limit switch Ymin=Y1 limit Switch Ymax=Y2 Limit switch Zmin=Touch probe. Signal pin to plate, negative to tool. For the safest configuration the endstops should be wired in the Normally Closed position (NC), to prevent wire disconnects from damaging the machine during the homing sequence. Mechanical endstops are connected to the signal and ground pins filtered or optical endstops use all three pins, connect these with extreme caution. Using the wrongs pins will damage your control board. Optical endstops are not recommended on a machine used for milling or routing. The debris can inhibit there function. SKR Pro \u00b6 Note Do not use the + (positive) pins or you will ruin your SKR Pro board. RAMBo \u00b6 Pay attention the pins are opposite each other, but clearly labeled on the board. Ramps \u00b6 Mini-RAMBo \u00b6 This board only has 4 drivers available and can easily be used with the LowRider CNC (Y axis) but cannot full take advantage of the new firmware with the MPCNC. Archim \u00b6 Firmware \u00b6 The dual endstop firmware is on the V1 Engineering Marlin Builder page page. Remember small 1mm moves when initially powering it up, if driving your steppers the wrong way you can rip your machine apart. If your steppers are moving the wrong direction, completely power off your board before flipping the plug over. Testing and Calibration \u00b6 After all the endstops have been connected issuing a M119 command will let you see the current status of each endstop. You should check that each endstop registers both an open and closed status before proceeding. Open when not touching and closed when they are. You can test them individually by closing each one by hand and running an M119 . Also verify the X1 corresponds to the X1 stepper. Then verify a positive movement is away from the end stops. The unfortunately designated M666 lets you test your offset to quickly calibrate your machine. Using the command M666 X0.72 would offset the X1 stepper 0.72mm away from its endstop, Y! can also be used. To verify your current settings during calibration just an M666 will show the current offsets. Once the correct offset are found you should input them into your firmware. This is to simplify the actual placement of the endstops themselves, you only need to get them such that the X1 or Y1 endstop is at or slightly behind where it needs to be within a few Millimeters is best. You can verify how square your axis is by measuring the diagonals of the largest rectangle you can draw in your build area. The larger the more accurate\u2026but also harder to measure. I only have 6\u2033 calipers but I was more accurate with a tape measure at my 440mm available diagonal. Measure the diagonals to the X1 and Y1 endstops blocks. Offset the endstop that has the short dimension by the amount it is short or just a hair over. So if the X1 diagonal was 1mm short you would offset X1 by 1mm. M666 X1. Tip \u2013 If it is more than 2mm off move the stop block, each belt tooth is 2mm. Draw a fresh one to verify. If that is correct you should edit your firmware to make this change permanent in configuration.h Or add it to all of your Gcode. Enjoy! Care should be taken to use as little pen pressure as possible with the finest tip possible to get the most accurate results and a pen mount with some give should be used, example pen mount . My trials and tribulations figuring this out\u2026.Feel free to make fun of me. Forum link . Use \u00b6 First, most jobs will not benefit from using endstops. Getting the machine close and just running a quick one off carving or sign has no need to go through all the extra steps. People new to the CNC world should not use this; this is an advanced technique. My support for this will be limited. You can now use the machine in two ways. Quick one off jobs as you always would setting the home position by hand and just running the job. Or by starting each job with a G28 (if using a touch plate) you can now reference or return to that position at any time. If you are not using a touch plate you can use G28 X Y You can use fixtures at a set reference points on the table to do repeat jobs or multiple sided cuts utilizing CAM based work offsets or scripts. Tool changes can be done with multiple gcodes so you can do repeat jobs in order of bit used instead of per piece depending on if changing the part of the bit is the faster choice. Jobs can be restarted in case of power outage, tool breaks, long multi day jobs, apply paint between cuts, etc. If you don\u2019t need the endstops you can just insert the command, G92 X0 Y0 Z0 , in your gcode before the cut starts. This should allow for normal use without homing or work offsets, also no squaring. For more info please see the Milling Basics page. Work offsets \u00b6 Make sure your job has a work offset if you use the endstops. A typical part has the gcode built with the origin at the parts corner. If you were to cut out that part it would result in going negative past your endstops and misalign your machine. Negative moves do not work on the X and Y axis with endstops. Moving the origin in your CAM program is the easiest fix. To get a more precise work offset it is best to add it in your CAD file. This can be done with a bounding box, cut it as a separate path and used to position your material.","title":"Dual Endstops"},{"location":"electronics/dual-endstops/#auto-square-dual-endstops","text":"","title":"Auto Square, Dual EndStops"},{"location":"electronics/dual-endstops/#basics","text":"The Dual EndStop firmware update enables unprecedented precision more easily than ever before.

Please ask questions in the forums if this doesn\u2019t make sense. There are some very helpful people who would like you to succeed, and this document won\u2019t do that for everyone. Also, feel free to edit this document with improvements. There is a little pencil in the upper right, and we review each change before publishing it. There are 5 motors on a Low Rider. One on each Z axis, one on the router plate, and two on the other axis. This article is about the wiring needed to set up the Low Rider so that each motor has its own driver, and each driver has its own endstop, while also allowing the Z probe for fine carving operations. Do I need this? \u00b6 First off. You should realize that there are hundreds of Low Riders wired with the series wiring. In many ways, series wiring is simpler. Endstops aren\u2019t needed at all, really. Here are some things you may not know about series wiring and endstops: Series wiring provides the same amount of power to each motor. Endstops aren\u2019t needed in CNC. The origin is determined by the workpiece (unlike in 3D printing). In series or dual endstop configurations, the mirrored motors move exactly in lock step after homing. Homing isn\u2019t needed in CNC. You can just define where the origin is. If you start the machine square and keep the motors engaged, the machine will stay square. Getting a 5 foot gantry square isn\u2019t that difficult. The large size makes it easier than on an MPCNC. Here are the advantages of a Dual Endstop configuration: Auto squaring. If you home a dual endstop machine, each motor will move until it reaches its own endstop. Because of this, you can start the machine out of square, home, and be confident the machine will stay square. If you have your work set up in a known location, you can split the work into multiple files, and continue the next day after homing. You can home to move the gantry up all the way, giving you room to work. What do I need to do this? \u00b6 A control board with at least 5 drivers. The Full sized Rambo has 5. The Skr Pro has 6. These two boards have configurations preconfigured in the MarlinBuilder. If you\u2019re using a board with removable drivers, you need to have 5 drivers. For example, on the Skr Pro, you could use series wiring with 3 drivers, but this needs 5. A wire for each motor. And endstop for each motor. These should be the dumb switches with 3 pins (C, NC, NO). Not the ones with the little circuit board attached. Those only cause trouble. The Y axis needs to be the belt and wheel axis. The X axis needs to be the belt and tube axis. If you have this reversed, then you will need to edit the preconfigured firmware. A computer you can control it with, or at least the TFT screen is really helpful. This is an advanced setup, and it requires some specific testing that can\u2019t be done over the LCD Rep Rap Full Discount Display. Wiring \u00b6 Note These instructions are for the preconfigured firmware from MarlinBuilder. They assume you have 2xY and 1xX motors. Rambo and SKR users Read these instructions, but also read specific instructions for the Rambo and Skr Pro boards. Here is where we are trying to get to: Motor Driver Endstop X X Xmin Y1 Y Ymin Y2 E0 Ymax Z1 Z Zmax Z2 E1 Xmax Warning Pay special attention to the Z2. This is a bit different. Pay special attention to the Z1 endstop, this is in the Zmax port. Motor Drivers \u00b6 The motors should be wired directly to the board. Most steppers come wired AABB, meaning the first two wires are one coil, and the next two wires are the second coil. Since there are 5 drivers, each motor goes straight to a single driver. There are two motor ports on the Z driver. Don\u2019t use the second and leave it blank. ( A picture here sure would be nice ). The Second Y motor goes to the E0 port and the second Z motor goes to the E1 port. Endstops \u00b6 Match up each endstop with the appropriate motor. Warning All endstops should be wired between the Ground (-) and the Signal (s). Don\u2019t use the Positive (+). All the endstops should also be wired to the Common (C) and Normally Closed (NC) connectors on the switches. The X endstop goes in the Xmin port and needs to be mounted on the negative X axis. The Y1 endstop goes in the Ymin port, needs to be on the negative Y side, and needs to be on the side with the motor that is plugged into the Y port. The Y2 endstop goes in the Ymax port, needs to be on the negative Y side, and needs to be on the side with the motor that is plugged into the E0 port. Note The Z homes up. Why? so we can still use a Z min probe to probe the workpiece. Be very careful though, if you home up and miss the endstops, you will take apart your low rider. Not cool. The Z1 endstop goes in the Zmax port, needs to be on the positive Z side, and needs to be on the side with the motor that is plugged into the Z port. The Z2 endstop goes in the Xmax (that is X, not Z) port, needs to be on the positive Z side, and needs to be on the side with the motor that is plugged into the E1 port. Info Be sure you test the endstops with M119 and confirm the direction of all motors before trying to home anything. Z probe \u00b6 The Z probe will help you measure the top of the workpiece you are about to make a mess with. This isn\u2019t needed in most cases, because you can just jog the machine to the top and set the Z=0 with G92 Z0 . But it can be really helpful for tool changes, and it can take out some of the guess work of carving. The wiring of the Z probe is the same as with an MPCNC or a serial wiring Low Rider. The touch plate connects to the Ground (-) pin on Zmin. The Signal pin (s) of the Zmin connects to the bit. You can use an alligator clip, or a magnet to connect the bit electrically. When the bit touches the plate, it looks like a closed switch, and it should trigger Marlin to stop the Z axis. Test the functionality of the plate before probing. Use M119 and make sure it reports zmin_probe is open when the bit isn\u2019t touching the plate, and TRIGGERED when the bit is touching the plate. The normal \u201cHome Z\u201d will lift the gantry, and not probe down. To probe down, you need to use a different command. That is G38.2 Z0 . This command will search downward for the touch plate with the bit. Warning If you miss, it may stretch out the couplers, causing damage. Example gcode script for probe: M0 Attach probe ; Remind the user to attach the probe G38.2 Z0 ; Home down for the touchplate G92 Z0.5 ; Sets the offset for the touchplate, if the touchplate is 0.5mm thick G1 Z10 F300 ; lifts the Z out of the way M0 Remove probe ; Remind the user to remove the probe Wiring for Rambo \u00b6 (A picture or two would be really nice) Pay attention to the endstop pin definitions. They flip direction for the max ports. Skr Pro \u00b6 (A picture or two would be really nice) The endstops are connected through the board to the sensorless homing pins on the TMC2209s. Currently, you need to bend, cut, or desolder the sensorless homing endstop pin. The second Z port comes with two little jumpers. Those need to remain installed. Testing \u00b6 Don\u2019t go crazy and expect everything to be set up correctly right away. There are a lot of places where a wire can get loose, or something could be wrong with the configuration (we do our best, but mistakes happen). Build up confidence in the different parts one step at a time, and you will end up with smaller areas to search for problems. Note For simplicity, I am going to assume you are doing this checkout with a computer attached to the USB port, and have it connected using Repetier Host. If you get in trouble, don\u2019t get frustrated, these instructions aren\u2019t perfect. Go ask for help in the forums . Motors \u00b6 Check the motors are moving the right way, and the mirrored motors are moving together. - For the preconfigured Dual LR files, the Y axis is the axis on wheels and the X axis is the axis on tubes/bearings. - Higher Z values should raise the gantry up. - Higher X values should move to the right. - Higher Y values should move away from you. - You may have to change which side of the table you stand on to make that true. When using CAM, understand that this is the side of the table you have to imagine standing on. Check the distance the motors move. If you command a 10mm movement, it should move 10mm. If it moves 20mm, or 5mm, there is a problem. If it is 10.1mm, worry about it later, that passed this test. Run the test crown pattern. Post the result to the forums, and some pics of your machine. You should really consider taking a break and making a mess. This machine is in great shape now, and it can easily handle making a coaster to help you with the next steps. Endstops \u00b6 Before doing any homing, you want to make sure the motors are working. You already drew the crown, right? Here\u2019s how you check your endstops: Send M119 (Send GCode, and then look at the console for the response). The correct endstop should show \u201copen\u201d when the switch isn\u2019t pressed and \u201cTRIGGERED\u201d when it is pressed. Pay attention to match the correct motor to the correct endstop. Check the table above for the correct order. The Z probe should show \u201copen\u201d when the bit isn\u2019t touching the plate, and \u201cTRIGGERED\u201d when the bit is touching the plate. Be sure to test on the actual router, in the same situation you\u2019ll use for setting up a job (as best you can). Sometimes just having the router plugged into AC can affect the probe. Double check that reducing the X and Y cause the machine to go towards the endstops. Double check that increasing the Z causes the machine to go towards the endstops. Homing/Probing \u00b6 OK. One you\u2019re ready to try your first home. To Home X, you can press the Home X button or send G28 X in the Send Gcode. You can do the same with Y and Z. To test the probe, get the plate, the bit, and everything ready and send G38.2 Z0. The bit should go down, and feel free to touch it early. If something goes wrong, you\u2019re going to want to pull the power immediately. You can stretch the Z couplers if it plows into the table.","title":"Dual Endstops Low Rider"},{"location":"electronics/dual-lr/#dual-endstops-on-a-low-rider","text":"Info This is a WIP. Please ask questions in the forums if this doesn\u2019t make sense. There are some very helpful people who would like you to succeed, and this document won\u2019t do that for everyone. Also, feel free to edit this document with improvements. There is a little pencil in the upper right, and we review each change before publishing it. There are 5 motors on a Low Rider. One on each Z axis, one on the router plate, and two on the other axis. This article is about the wiring needed to set up the Low Rider so that each motor has its own driver, and each driver has its own endstop, while also allowing the Z probe for fine carving operations.","title":"Dual Endstops on a Low Rider"},{"location":"electronics/dual-lr/#do-i-need-this","text":"First off. You should realize that there are hundreds of Low Riders wired with the series wiring. In many ways, series wiring is simpler. Endstops aren\u2019t needed at all, really. Here are some things you may not know about series wiring and endstops: Series wiring provides the same amount of power to each motor. Endstops aren\u2019t needed in CNC. The origin is determined by the workpiece (unlike in 3D printing). In series or dual endstop configurations, the mirrored motors move exactly in lock step after homing. Homing isn\u2019t needed in CNC. You can just define where the origin is. If you start the machine square and keep the motors engaged, the machine will stay square. Getting a 5 foot gantry square isn\u2019t that difficult. The large size makes it easier than on an MPCNC. Here are the advantages of a Dual Endstop configuration: Auto squaring. If you home a dual endstop machine, each motor will move until it reaches its own endstop. Because of this, you can start the machine out of square, home, and be confident the machine will stay square. If you have your work set up in a known location, you can split the work into multiple files, and continue the next day after homing. You can home to move the gantry up all the way, giving you room to work.","title":"Do I need this?"},{"location":"electronics/dual-lr/#what-do-i-need-to-do-this","text":"A control board with at least 5 drivers.

This isn\u2019t needed in most cases, because you can just jog the machine to the top and set the Z=0 with G92 Z0 . But it can be really helpful for tool changes, and it can take out some of the guess work of carving. The wiring of the Z probe is the same as with an MPCNC or a serial wiring Low Rider. The touch plate connects to the Ground (-) pin on Zmin. The Signal pin (s) of the Zmin connects to the bit. You can use an alligator clip, or a magnet to connect the bit electrically. When the bit touches the plate, it looks like a closed switch, and it should trigger Marlin to stop the Z axis. Test the functionality of the plate before probing. Use M119 and make sure it reports zmin_probe is open when the bit isn\u2019t touching the plate, and TRIGGERED when the bit is touching the plate. The normal \u201cHome Z\u201d will lift the gantry, and not probe down. To probe down, you need to use a different command. That is G38.2 Z0 .

When using CAM, understand that this is the side of the table you have to imagine standing on. Check the distance the motors move. If you command a 10mm movement, it should move 10mm. If it moves 20mm, or 5mm, there is a problem. If it is 10.1mm, worry about it later, that passed this test. Run the test crown pattern. Post the result to the forums, and some pics of your machine.

Beyond the basics there are loads of extra pins, options for two different power supplies at two different voltages, WiFi Ports, future expansion port for USB, and the Trinamic TMC series of drivers are all prewired into the board so there are no extra wires needed. Want to Buy one? SKR Pro Bundle is available here in the shop. There are many options involved here. To offer the best experience for most users I have settled on the TMC2209 drivers, and the TFT35 V3 E3 screen. Note Do not use a SKR Pro based machine with the microSD card in the SKR Pro board. This seems to cause random performance issues. 2209 Drivers \u00b6 The Trinamic 2209 V1.2 drivers offer UART communication for dynamic control, 2A RMS with a 2.8A peak. We will be operating far under these values. The Trinamic drivers have many advanced features. For a CNC Machine, the main features we use are digital current control and dynamically lowering the hold current so we can also keep stepper and driver heat down while operating at slightly higher than usual stepper power! Disable Sensorless Pin \u00b6 Sensorless homing is not currently as accurate as mechanical end stops. All the pre-compiled firmware has this disabled so you will need to bend the pins out of the way. Bend this pin on each driver to allow mechanical switches to be used on the SKR board. UART \u00b6 For the firmware to be able to control the current and receive feedback from each driver the board needs to be set for UART communication. To do this you remove the 4 jumpers from each port and place one jumper on the black (UART) pins. There is no need to monkey with the tiny potentiometers! The completed board looks like this. Notice there are no jumpers under the drivers. At this point you can add the heat sinks being careful not to short any of the pins and only stick them to the copper pads on the top. Molex and JST connectors \u00b6 The current V1 Engineering wiring kits have the Molex style terminations on them. The SKR Pro is the first board to be offered with JST directional style connections. Instead of buying adapters, another custom set of wires, or custom SKR boards, a pretty easy solution is just pulling off the JST plastic shields. The pin spacing is the same (or close enough) and pulling the shields off make for a more solid connection to the Molex style more commonly used. Needle nosed pliers and a little wiggling make this pretty easy. Depending on what you are plugging in you can take them off the end stops and or stepper ports. Even after doing this you should always constrain your wires directly after the connection to the board. Wiring Steppers \u00b6 We have a few options for how the steppers get connected to this board. Here are the three most common ways we might use it. Dual End Stops (EXTRUDERS=0) \u00b6 If the firmware is set for EXTRUDERS=0 then E0 becomes X2 and E1 becomes Y2. (or LR would be E0=Y2 E1=Z2) Dual End Stops (EXTRUDERS=1 -OLD-) \u00b6 For EXTRUDERS=1 E0 is used and then E1 becomes X2 and E2 become Y2. (or LR would be E1=Y2 and E2=Z2) Series (-OLD- or 4 driver boards) \u00b6 The standard LowRider and MPCNC options are to use series wiring. This combines two steppers on the same driver. This increases the voltage demand and not the current. We have an abundance of available voltage. The board is labeled, and we will be using X, Y, and Z. Reversing a stepper \u00b6 If your stepper is moving the wrong way you can power down and flip the plug over to change the direction of rotation. If you are using the series wiring harness flipping the board end changes both steppers, or changing one stepper in the chain reverse that one only. Screen TFT35 V3 E3 \u00b6 This screen was chosen because it had a knob (great for dirty environments). We can use it from both Touchscreen mode and Classic mode, simultaneously. Switching between modes is as easy as pressing the knob in for 3 seconds. You do not need to use both; pay attention to the direction the wires are facing when connecting them. Touch plate \u00b6 All the V1 firmware is ready for a touch plate. Easy as plugging into the Z min port. Dual End Stops, End Stops \u00b6 If you are running the dual endstop firmware you will need to have your endstops wired in Normally Closed (NC). You will plug into the Signal and Ground pins, Do not use the + pins. MPCNC Dual Endstops LowRider Dual endstops Note Do not use the + (positive) pins or you will ruin your SKR Pro board unless you are running a different project with powered endstops. Firmware \u00b6 The SKR Pro and TFT screen both can use a bin file to re-flash the firmware. This is as simple as placing some files directly on the memory card and rebooting them. SKR Bin \u00b6 You have options of firmware for the exact board, driver, screen package as sold in the V1 store. V1CNC_SkrPro_2209- * * Ready for series wiring on any CNC build. V1CNC_SkrPro_Dual_2209- * * Ready for dual end stops on an MPCNC (X & Y axes). V1CNC_SkrPro_DualLR_2209- * * Ready for dual end stops on a LowRider CNC (Y & Z axes). When you unzip the file you have a .bin file. Rename to FIRMWARE.bin and save it to the MicroSD for the SKR Pro board. Make sure to unplug both grey exp\u00bd cables for the screen before proceeding. Insert the MicroSD back into the control board, reset, and the board will flash a few green LED\u2019s for a second or two. The board now has new firmware (seriously that easy). Remove the Micro SD card, after flashing Note Do not use a SKR Pro based machine with the microSD card in the SKR Pro board. This seems to cause random performance issues. The file will change extensions when a successful flash happens. Current release bin files, V1 Engineering pre-configured firmware . You also have the option to get the full Marlin source and edit and compile yourself using Platformio Docs . TFT Files \u00b6 Flashing the screen takes a .bin file, the config file, and usually the TFT35 folder (unzipped) on the root of the screens SD card. BIGTREE_TFT35_V3.0_E3. * *.bin config.ini TFT35 (folder) you do not need the folder present for minor updates it is just for graphics and languages. Now reset the screen (or board) and watch the screen update itself. You can double check and the files will have a new extension after a successful flash. The V1 Engineering CNC version of the TFT firmware is on this page, use the most recent and the files can be had under the assets drop down - TFT Firmware TFT Touch reset \u00b6 If you somehow mess up the touch calibration placing and empty reset.txt file on the card and resetting will trigger a re-calibration. Compile your own (source) \u00b6 If you want to make any changes you will need to compile form the source files using Platform.io. Here is a basic walk through, Platformio Docs .

When you turn on the machine, where ever it starts is the start line. If you use the LCD or computer to move it, you are moving away from the start point, but the start point is in the same place it was. When you start the race, you have to return to the start line. Zeroing out your coordinates moves the start line to where you currently are. Exactly. Setting the zero, or the \u201corigin\u201d is important so your machine knows where to start the job. Equally important is that the directions you move are going the right way. X, Y, and Z may seem arbitrary to you, but they are not (but they are a bit flexible). We\u2019ll talk about the three axis, and their directions in Coordinate Directions . Coordinates are used with every job, and it is important to set them right. Origin \u00b6 The \u201cOrigin\u201d or \u201cHome\u201d or \u201cZero\u201d is the single place where the X,Y and Z coordinates are equal to 0.000. This can be anywhere. It is set in your CAM, and then when you set up your job, you will tell the controller where you want it so the rest of the cut is in the right place. Here is an example: You design a simple shape, a 10mm square. In CAM, you choose to cut 10mm deep. You set the origin in CAM to be at the top of the workpiece, and the lower left corner of the design. On your machine, you bolt down your work, install the bit, all that stuff. You then jog to the lower left corner of your work. You adjust the Z so the bit is just touching the top surface of the material. You now Set the origin to this location . Start the router, play the g-code file, and the box is cut down 10mm from where you started, and 10mm to the up and right. Warning If you hadn\u2019t set the origin. The machine would have just assumed wherever it started was the origin. That can lead to the first thing it does is just crash through your workpiece, crash through your spoil board, and try to get back to where it started. Not a fun day! Origin Locations \u00b6 Just to make this easier, there are just a few origin locations that make sense. Lower, Left, Top \u00b6 If you\u2019re cutting a flat part out of an oversized piece of material, this is the best way to go. You just put the origin near the lower left area of the material, and it will cut from that corner. It won\u2019t be easy to center it in the material, but that is OK. Center, Top \u00b6 If you are carving a logo, or some art, into the top of an existing workpiece, you might consider centering the XY location of the origin. For example, if you are carving a logo in a cabinet door. In this case, center the origin in CAM, and make sure the design is scaled to a size you like. Mark the center of your door, and set the origin there. The benefit of this option is that the ultimate carving will stay centered. It is easy to accidentally go over the edge of material if it is scaled wrong, which is why the LLT origin is better for new parts. Bottom Z \u00b6 Setting the origin to the top of the material means you will start at 0, and then move down into the negative coordinates to reach through the material you are cutting. If that doesn\u2019t make sense to you, you can also set the Z=0 to be the top of your spoil board, and start milling starting at the top of the workpiece. This isn\u2019t very common though, because the spoil board isn\u2019t as important (usually) as your work material, so getting it aligned with the top of the material is more useful. Setting the Origin \u00b6 There are different ways to set the origin. Each way has its own pros/cons. Using LCD \u00b6 If you have an LCD with your controller, you can use the menus to move the tool to the origin that you want. Once there, select the \u201cSet Home Position\u201d in the menus. Using Repetier Host \u00b6 Similar to the LCD method, use Repetier Host\u2019s controls to jog to the desired origin location, and then send a G92 X0 Y0 Z0 to set the origin. You also need to send a @isathome to reset Repetier\u2019s idea of where it is. Using Starting G-Code \u00b6 If you have your CAM software add in a G92 X0 Y0 Z0 at the start of the gcode file, then wherever you start your code will be the origin, because the first thing it will do is set the origin. This is what is done in the test crown, and it works pretty well, as long as you know it is there. Warning Be sure to pay attention to which files have this and which don\u2019t. It can be pretty easy to assume a file has this command, and forget to set the origin, and then watch it take off towards it\u2019s starting location. Alternatively, if you set the origin, and forget the gcode has a G92, then job somewhere else to start the job, it may be cutting air, and confusing you. Move the Gantry by Hand \u00b6 On an MPCNC, when the power is off, you can usually move the gantry by just pushing it to where you want it to go. Once you\u2019re at the origin you want, you can just turn on the controller and enable the steppers. Warning Moving the steppers too fast will generate current, which goes back into the controller. If you are moving them fast enough for the lights to turn on in the controller, you are in danger of turning your controller to smoke. Warning This doesn\u2019t work with some MPCNCs with large routers or the Low Rider. If the gantry falls on its own, then you can\u2019t easily set the Z. Info You can also use the LCD or Repetier Host to move the gantry under power. When you\u2019re there, you can just reset the controller to reset the origin. Using XY Endstops (Single or Dual) \u00b6 Option 1 \u00b6 Set the origin in you CAM to be the location of the endstops. Then put your material in the right place relative to your machine. The Z needs to be set separately. Option 2 \u00b6 Home the X and Y. You can then move to the desired origin by jogging the machine. When you get there, write down the current coordinates, and Set the home position. If you turn off the machine or lose your location, you can home again, and then jog to the coordinates you wrote down. Using Z Touch Plate \u00b6 Using one of the above methods, set your origin, and then jog the Z up. Attach your touch plate and home the Z. This can be done in these ways: Home Z in the LCD menu. Home Z button in Repetier-Host. G28 Z from the console. Info You can do this at any X or Y location you\u2019d like. If you\u2019re carving, you might want to probe near the middle of the workpiece so that you minimize the total error. But make sure you go back to X,Y zero before resetting the Z. Now, you need to remove the offset from the Touch plate. There are a couple of ways to do that too: Warning Don\u2019t forget to remove the touch plate before continuing. Jog the machine down the thickness of the touch plate and set the origin. Send a G92 Z0.5 to set the current position to 0.5mm. If your touch plate is a different thickness, use that thickness. Coordinate Directions \u00b6 When you\u2019re setting up the machine, you have some power over the coordinate directions. You can plug the motors into the X, Y, or Z drivers, and you can accidentally or intentionally reverse the plugs (which makes the motors go the other way). Basic Configuration \u00b6 If you just want to have a machine that works, and you don\u2019t care, then test to make sure the machine moves in this way (relative to you, when standing at the front of the machine): Higher X values go to the right. Higher Y values go away from you. Higher Z values go up (away from the spoil board). Info The best way to check the coordinates is to just carefully jog in a single direction at a time. If one of the axis moves the wrong direction, you can reverse the steppers . If two of the axis are swapped, you can move the wires to change the driver. Warning You can destroy your drivers if the steppers are enabled and you disconnect them. Always turn the power off before disconnecting the motors.

Advanced Configurations \u00b6 If you want a different coordinate frame, then you can have it.

You can also write some custom commands with a little effort and set up your machine faster than the couple of buttons your controller gives you. G-Code Files \u00b6 What is a .gcode file? A .gcode file is just a list of individual commands, which will be processed one at a time. That\u2019s it! There is no magic involved. You can rename a .gcode file with a .txt extension and open it in a text editor (like wordpad). Here are some instructions you might see in a .gcode file: G00 X 0.000 Y 0.000 Z 0.000 F 300.00 G01 Z -1.000 F 300.00 G01 X 10.000 F 600.00 Each of these lines is one single command. They are read in by the controller one at a time. If you typed in each of these commands into a console, the machine would work the same as if you played them from a G-Code sender (except, you couldn\u2019t go as fast). So, if we understand what each of these commands do, then we can understand the whole file. But, this just looks like gibberish to me!? This \u201clanguage\u201d is meant to be read by the controller and not by humans. But you don\u2019t have to be a coder to understand it. In fact, there are really just a few commands that we ever use, so it doesn\u2019t take long at all to learn. First G-Code Command \u00b6 G01 X10.000 F600.00 This is a single G-Code command. It starts with the kind of command G01 and then has two parameters X10.000 and F600.00 . G01 This is a G1 command, which means it is a movement command. All G01 does is tell the controller that the parameters are for a movement command. X10.000 When there is a movement command, the X tells the controller to move in the X direction. The number ( 10.000 ) tells the controller how far to move. In this case, it will move the X axis to the 10mm mark. F600.00 When there is a movement command, the F tells the controller how fast to move. In this command, this is 600mm/min, or 10mm/s. So, put it all together and this tells the controller to move to the X=10mm mark, at 10mm/s. In a movement command, X, Y, and Z are all possible. So here is some g-code for moving in a square 10mm on a side, at 10mm/s: G01 X0.000 Y0.000 F600 G01 X10.000 Y0.000 F600 G01 X10.000 Y10.000 F600 G01 X0.000 Y10.000 F600 G01 X0.000 Y0.000 F600 But wait, there are 4 sides on a square, and this is 5 commands! A movement command only describes where to go to . The previous location determines where to move from . To make a line, you need two movement commands. G-Code Variants \u00b6 G-Code is supposed to be a standard. But, it has a lot of uses, and a lot of ways it can be expanded. We use Marlin as controller software, so our g-code needs to be compatible with Marlin. Other CNC machines might use Grbl (which is mostly the same as Marlin) or Mach or LinuxCNC. Each of these has slight variations in the standard. For that reason it is important to look at the Marlin documentation for Gcode: Marlin G-Code Reference Another great g-code reference is the Rep Rap Reference . Just beware that Marlin doesn\u2019t maintain the Rep Rap reference, so even the Marlin specific information may be out of date. Comments \u00b6 Since G-Code isn\u2019t a human language, it is helpful to add in some comments to let people who are reading the code understand what you are saying. Machines will ignore the comments, so you can put anything you want in there. There are two formats for comments: Anything after a semicolon will be a comment. Ex: G01 X10.000 F600.00 ; This is a comment ; This is also a comment. Anything in parenthesis is a comment. Ex: G01 X10.000 F600.00 ( This is a comment ) ( This is also a comment. ) G1 vs. G01 \u00b6 G1 is the same as G01 . Marlin will ignore the extra 0. This is true for most commands. M-codes \u00b6 Some \u201cG-Codes\u201d start with an M . This is just a way to expand the number of commands. Capitalization \u00b6 All the letters should be capitalized. Marlin isn\u2019t looking for lowercase letters, and they look completely different to Marlin, so just use ALL CAPS. Specific G-Codes \u00b6 Here are some G-Codes that we will find very important. G0, G1 - Linear Move \u00b6 Marlin Reference If you don\u2019t define a speed, the previous speed will be used. G2, G3 - Arc Moves \u00b6 Marlin Reference These have had trouble with some versions of the firmware. Sometimes, it is better to configure your CAM to not use them, and instead, use linear moves to move around an arc. G28 - Home \u00b6 Marlin Reference It is generally only used with a specific axis on the CNC machine. For example: G28 Z ; Homes the Z axis only G90 - Absolute Positioning. \u00b6 Marlin Reference Most of the time, your movement commands will be in absolute coordinates. So make sure this is at the top of your gcode files. G92 - Set Position \u00b6 Marlin Reference M17 - Enable Steppers \u00b6 Marlin Reference M18, M84 - Disable Steppers \u00b6 Marlin Reference Configuration Codes \u00b6 Sometimes, it is useful to type on a console directly with the controller to investigate or to set specific commands. These codes are mostly useful in those cases: M115 - Firmware Information \u00b6 Marlin Reference M503 - Report Settings \u00b6 Marlin Reference M500 - Save Settings \u00b6 Marlin Reference M502 - Restore Factory Settings \u00b6 Marlin Reference M122 - TMC Debug Information \u00b6 Marlin Reference Only useful for TMC drivers, and only if you have TMC_DEBUG enabled.","title":"G-code"},{"location":"learn/gcode/#g-code-101","text":"","title":"G-code 101"},{"location":"learn/gcode/#introduction","text":"G-code may look complicated, but with just a little bit of knowledge, you can inspect the output of your CAM and be able to spot problems before they get to the machine.

Motion is the critical task we ask of our machines. Mostly, we don\u2019t worry too much about it, because it just works, but a little bit of understanding can go a long way if you\u2019ve got any issues with your motion. So let\u2019s talk about motion! Motion Background \u00b6 A G00 command is meant to indicate a travel move, or a move where there is no cutting involved. A G01 command is meant to indicate a cutting move. Info Marlin\u2019s main goal is 3D printing, and that makes it a little murky. In 3D printing, any move that doesn\u2019t extrude plastic is a travel move. By default, it doesn\u2019t see a distinction between G00 and G01 . Marlin has its own rules for maximum speed, and acceleration. Marlin also supports \u201cjerk\u201d setting, but this isn\u2019t the derivative of the acceleration. You can also set the \u201cJunction Deviation\u201d which replaces jerk. Each command has a \u201cFeedrate\u201d. If you don\u2019t define one, it will just use the previous one. G-Code Feedrate \u00b6 Example G-Code \u00b6 Look at these commands (for more detail, look at the g-code tutorial ): G00 X0.00 Y0.00 Z0.00 G00 X10.00 G01 Z-0.1 F300.00 G01 X100.00 F600 G01 Y100.00 At first, it looks fine. But there is a problem. The first two commands don\u2019t have a feedrate defined. So whatever speed the last command was at, is what is going to be used. At the 3 rd line, we finally set a feedrate. On the 4 th , it is changed to something new, and on the last line, there is no feedrate, so the 600 is used again. Details \u00b6 The feed rates in gcode describe the speed to travel along the line. So, for example, if you were at 0,0 and you were travelling to 100mm,100mm, and the feedrate was set to 100mm/s, it would travel at a speed of 100mm/s, but have 140mm to travel, so it would take about 1.4s to get there. If you sent the same command with a feedrate of 140mm/s, then it would take 1 second to finish that move. The limits on the speeds in Marlin are axis based. So if you set the max speed rate in X to 50mm/s and the max feedrate in Y to 50mm/s, Marlin will slow down this move to not exceed that speed on either axis. So the speed would end up being 70mm/s, and finish in about 2 seconds. So I use these terms in this document: Feedrate The maximum speed along the straight line in gcode. Max Speed The maximum speed along a single axis. Note In the past, some versions of Marlin have not protected against speeds higher than their max. All indications are the current Marlin (V1Engineering 418+) are responding well to adjustments in the max feedrate. Those total timing numbers aren\u2019t completely right. Because Marlin also doesn\u2019t go from a full stop to top speed instantly. It will use the acceleration values to decide how quickly to ramp up the speed to its top speed. So this move that takes 2s and maxes out at 50mm/s in each direction will actually take a bit longer, because it will start out slower, and work its way up to 50mm/s. Then at the end, it will slow down before the end of the 100mm, and stop smoothly. You can really see the effect if you drop your accelerations very slow. Movements are smoother, but they sometimes take a lot longer. The accelerations are also applied on a per axis basis, so on a high speed move, the X axis will be accelerating at its max acceleration and the Y will be accelerating at its max acceleration. The total acceleration on a compound move will be higher along the line. Jerk, or Junction Deviation are used because even on the corner of a square, you don\u2019t want to stop completely. That will just slow things down more than necessary. These other parameters consider how fast to take a turn. Adjusting Max Speed \u00b6 You can easily change the max speeds and accelerations because they are stored in the EEPROM, and they are read in every time you start (or boot) Marlin. You can change these at any time, but remember to save your changes by writing out to the EEPROM. M203 X30 Y30 Z10 This will set the X and Y speeds to 30mm/s (notice this is in mm/s, whereas feed rates are in mm/min) and the Z to 10mm/s. M500 This will save all the value to the EEPROM. Marlin Reference Generally, the defaults in the V1Engineering firmware are conservative enough for these machines. If you want to go faster and know the consequences, then by all means, change them. If you installed a high steps/mm Z and you need to slow down your Z, then this is a good way to do it. Here is the general rule of thumb for speeds. You shouldn\u2019t allow the machine to go so fast that it skips steps when not cutting material. Friction in the machine, or loss of torque at high speeds can contribute to lost steps at higher speeds, so you\u2019ll want to test at high speeds, and then reduce the parameter to stay away from trouble. Adjusting Max Accelerations \u00b6 You can change the accelerations similarly to the speeds, just use M204 instead. Again, the V1Engineering accelerations should be a good start for almost everyone. If you have a lot of steps/mm, the acceleration doesn\u2019t need to be changed. The acceleration is more based on the amount of mass you are moving and rigidity of the machine. You will want to test your accelerations by sending a large move command at max speed. For example, an X move of 100mm at 1000mm/s. The Acceleration and speeds will be maxed out, and if you skip any steps, then you need to go way lower. Some people prefer a much smaller acceleration, because it makes the machine seem more gentle or smart. Configuring Separate Travel Speeds \u00b6 By default, Marlin treats G00 commands as though they were just G01 commands. But many of the CNC friendly G-Code Senders and CAM use G00 to just move the machine as fast as possible. Because of this default treatment in Marlin, the last feedrate requested in a G01 command will be used in a G00 command. If you don\u2019t want that behavior, and you want G00 to just move as fast as possible, you can use this option in the Configuration_adv.h: // Enable and set a (default) feedrate for all G0 moves //#define G0_FEEDRATE 3000 // (mm/m) #ifdef G0_FEEDRATE //#define VARIABLE_G0_FEEDRATE // The G0 feedrate is set by F in G0 motion mode #endif If you define G0_FEEDRATE , then that will always get used for G0 commands (and still be subject to the max speeds and accelerations). If you define that and VARIABLE_G0_FEEDRATE , then any feedrate defined on a G0 command will stick and any future G0 commands will use that speed (unless they define their own). One useful configuration might be to set your max speeds and accelerations to something that will never skip (in air) and then set the G0_FEEDRATE to something high. All travel moves will be as fast as possible after that.","title":"Motion"},{"location":"learn/motion/#motion-101","text":"","title":"Motion 101"},{"location":"learn/motion/#introduction","text":"Try to explain a CNC machine to a 5 year old, and you\u2019ll probably say something like, \u201cIt moves a tool around to cut out shapes\u201d.

A G01 command is meant to indicate a cutting move. Info Marlin\u2019s main goal is 3D printing, and that makes it a little murky. In 3D printing, any move that doesn\u2019t extrude plastic is a travel move. By default, it doesn\u2019t see a distinction between G00 and G01 . Marlin has its own rules for maximum speed, and acceleration. Marlin also supports \u201cjerk\u201d setting, but this isn\u2019t the derivative of the acceleration. You can also set the \u201cJunction Deviation\u201d which replaces jerk. Each command has a \u201cFeedrate\u201d. If you don\u2019t define one, it will just use the previous one.","title":"Motion Background"},{"location":"learn/motion/#g-code-feedrate","text":"","title":"G-Code Feedrate"},{"location":"learn/motion/#example-g-code","text":"Look at these commands (for more detail, look at the g-code tutorial ): G00 X0.00 Y0.00 Z0.00 G00 X10.00 G01 Z-0.1 F300.00 G01 X100.00 F600 G01 Y100.00 At first, it looks fine. But there is a problem. The first two commands don\u2019t have a feedrate defined. So whatever speed the last command was at, is what is going to be used. At the 3 rd line, we finally set a feedrate. On the 4 th , it is changed to something new, and on the last line, there is no feedrate, so the 600 is used again.","title":"Example G-Code"},{"location":"learn/motion/#details","text":"The feed rates in gcode describe the speed to travel along the line. So, for example, if you were at 0,0 and you were travelling to 100mm,100mm, and the feedrate was set to 100mm/s, it would travel at a speed of 100mm/s, but have 140mm to travel, so it would take about 1.4s to get there. If you sent the same command with a feedrate of 140mm/s, then it would take 1 second to finish that move. The limits on the speeds in Marlin are axis based. So if you set the max speed rate in X to 50mm/s and the max feedrate in Y to 50mm/s, Marlin will slow down this move to not exceed that speed on either axis. So the speed would end up being 70mm/s, and finish in about 2 seconds. So I use these terms in this document: Feedrate The maximum speed along the straight line in gcode. Max Speed The maximum speed along a single axis. Note In the past, some versions of Marlin have not protected against speeds higher than their max. All indications are the current Marlin (V1Engineering 418+) are responding well to adjustments in the max feedrate. Those total timing numbers aren\u2019t completely right. Because Marlin also doesn\u2019t go from a full stop to top speed instantly. It will use the acceleration values to decide how quickly to ramp up the speed to its top speed. So this move that takes 2s and maxes out at 50mm/s in each direction will actually take a bit longer, because it will start out slower, and work its way up to 50mm/s. Then at the end, it will slow down before the end of the 100mm, and stop smoothly. You can really see the effect if you drop your accelerations very slow. Movements are smoother, but they sometimes take a lot longer. The accelerations are also applied on a per axis basis, so on a high speed move, the X axis will be accelerating at its max acceleration and the Y will be accelerating at its max acceleration. The total acceleration on a compound move will be higher along the line. Jerk, or Junction Deviation are used because even on the corner of a square, you don\u2019t want to stop completely. That will just slow things down more than necessary. These other parameters consider how fast to take a turn.","title":"Details"},{"location":"learn/motion/#adjusting-max-speed","text":"You can easily change the max speeds and accelerations because they are stored in the EEPROM, and they are read in every time you start (or boot) Marlin.

However, when broken down into manageable pieces it\u2019s easy to digest. Here, we will describe the different steps in the CNC milling workflow process along with their associated software components/tools. The goal is to provide you a better understanding of some of the steps and terminology, which in turn gives you the background to better seek help and explore possibilities. Overview \u00b6 This is the 1000ft (304m) overview (we will explore each in more detail within the sections that follow). There are 4 components to the workflow and associated software as follows: Step Software 1 Design CAD (Computer Assisted Design) or Vector Graphics Editor 2 Toolpath Generation CAM (Computer Assisted Machining) 3 G-Code Sending Sender 4 Milling Controller Design The first step is to make or get a design. If you are making one, then you will probably use a CAD program (for functional parts, like a gear) or a Vector Graphics Editor (for art, like a sign). The output of this step is typically either a 2D file (like a .DXF or .SVG) or sometimes (but not often) a 3D file (like a .STL). Toolpath Generation This is the step where you take your design, and describe which lines to engrave, which areas to cut out, and which parts to leave. It defines what \u201cpaths\u201d your \u201ctool\u201d is going to take. CAM also is where you will define what kinds of milling bits you have, and how fast and deep you want to move them through the material. The output of this step is g-code (in a .gcode or .nc file). G-code is the \u201clanguage\u201d of the instructions for your CNC. G-code Sender The g-code is just a list of instructions that define where the tool should go. The software used to \u201cplay\u201d these instructions is the g-code sender and communicates with the controller. There are a number of options for this software. Most people have a personal preference along with it being well matched with your controller. Controller The controller is responsible for taking g-code instructions and managing the precise movements of the motors. There are other jobs, but they are all related to this one function. There is firmware (software on a chip) that facilitates this. In the CNC world there are many \u201cflavors\u201d of this firmware. In our CNC machines, the most common flavors are Marlin and Grbl. Design \u00b6 There are many options for CAD and Vector Graphics Editors. Either can take thousands of hours to master. So we can\u2019t go into too much detail here. Luckily, you don\u2019t have to be a master to get your hands dirty. There are two common methods of creating designs for a CNC machine: Note Sometimes, you can find a design that is already a .DXF or a .SVG. If so, great! You can easily skip the Design step. In fact, for signs, there are many SVG\u2019s on Etsy that are inexpensive to purchase. Functional Parts Design \u00b6 If you are making functional parts, then you want a CAD tool. The output you want is usually .DXF. Imagine you want to make a toolbox, you would draw out each side of the toolbox and export a .DXF for each face of the box. You care a lot about the size of each side, because it all has to fit together when you are done. These programs can all create DXF files and they all have a lot of information on their use (This is not an exhaustive list, but if you want to add something else, feel free to edit this document . Autodesk Fusion 360 Onshape.com SketchUp OpenSCAD LibreCAD TinkerCAD Art Design \u00b6 If you want to carve out art, signs, lettering, or logos then you\u2019ll want to use .SVG files. These parts have important dimensions and measurements, but they are usually drawn in programs specializing in art. The most common programs are Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator. In these programs, you can very precisely adjust the shape to get an aesthetically pleasing design, or import another design and adjust it. Note If you have a piece of art in a .jpg, .png, or .bmp format, you can\u2019t directly use that. To make it usable, you can use Inkscape. Try searching for inkscape trace bitmap tutorial Toolpath Generation/CAM \u00b6 Note If you are familiar with 3D printing, this is similar to the slicer step (but not as automated). Now that you have a design, you basically have just a bunch of shapes or objects. You still haven\u2019t said which shapes need to be cut out, which shapes need to be engraved or drilled, and which shapes need to be completely removed. In CAM, you will select the shapes and choose which operations you want to perform. For example, if you are cutting out letters, you will need to use CAM to cut out each letter. You will also need to tell it how far to cut. It doesn\u2019t know anything about the material, so if you\u2019re cutting through 10mm ply or 5mm ply, you need to tell it so it doesn\u2019t over cut (too much). You also haven\u2019t told the machine how fast or deep to cut. There are many different settings related to the cutting (for example, how fast to \u201cplunge\u201d or dive into the material, how fast to move through the material, what kind of pattern to use when cutting out a pocket). Each material, each machine, and each bit will require a different set of parameters for how fast to move material, how many passes to take, and how deep you can go on each pass. There is a real art to making good CAM. Knowing your machine and making lots of test cuts can make a lot of difference in total time spent, and output quality. After CAM understands everything you want it to do, it will make a g-code file. The g-code file is a list of instructions for the Controller. It is important that the instructions are compatible with the controller you have. If you bought a controller from V1Engineering\u2019s shop, then it is running Marlin, and the CAM software needs to be configured to output g-code files compatible with the Marlin controller. There is a lot more detailed information in the Milling Basics , Estlcam Basics , and Estlcam 2.5D . Warning Fusion 360 does have CAM built in, and there is a Post processor available for it. It works great, but Fusion 360 CAM can be confusing, and it is highly recommended to start with Estlcam first. Even if you decide to later use the Fusion 360 CAM, the skills learned with Estlcam will be easier to learn, and will directly apply to any CAM software. G-code Sender \u00b6 The term \u201cG-code Sender\u201d isn\u2019t a very technical term, because there are so many ways to \u201cplay back\u201d a g-code file. A g-code file is just a list of instructions, with one instruction on each line. These need to be played back, one after another, so that the controller knows what to do. In addition to playback of g-code files, this software also does some basic setup. It needs to be able to send \u201cjog\u201d commands, which just move the machine around in one direction at a time. And it also needs to be able to set the \u201czero\u201d location to set up the cut. In dual endstop machines, it should also be able to command the homing sequence (Most CNC machines don\u2019t need endstops like 3D printers because the start location is on the workpiece, not the machine). The simplest method to do this is with Repetier-Host . The other simple method is to also install an LCD screen on the controller, which will take an SD card. You can put the file on the SD card, and set the whole thing up on the LCD, and play the file without bringing a computer into the shop. There are many other advanced ways to send gcode. You can hook up a raspberry pi, and use the v1pi image . You can use CNC.js standalone on your computer, or use pronterface. Controller/Firmware \u00b6 The final step is to actually do the milling/cutting. Obviously this is done by the tool at the end of the gantry, but it is facilitated by the controller. The controller takes movement commands, and drives the motors. If you bought the controller from the V1Engineering shop, then it is running Marlin. Marlin is designed for 3D printing (and so are a lot of tools we use). Don\u2019t be surprised if you see something labeled \u201cprint\u201d when you think it should be \u201ccut\u201d. The V1Engineering Shop sells the controllers flashed and ready to use. If you want to update them, or you need to change the software for some reason, there are preconfigured versions of Marlin for some boards. There are a lot more detailed instructions in the Marlin firmware section of the docs.\u2019 Warning You will see \u201cArduino\u201d used a lot in discussions around the V1Engineering machines. It is the software used to flash the controller. It is not involved with running the machine. Summary \u00b6 That really is it. If you see someone talking about software or firmware in the forums, it is probably something that fits into one of these categories. Don\u2019t get intimidated, and do ask questions. We were all beginners at some point (many of us, not that long ago).","title":"Software Workflow"},{"location":"learn/software_overview/#software-workflow","text":"Starting out in the CNC world can be very intimidating, even if you already know about 3D printing (which is a CNC machine, technically).

Now that you have a design, you basically have just a bunch of shapes or objects. You still haven\u2019t said which shapes need to be cut out, which shapes need to be engraved or drilled, and which shapes need to be completely removed. In CAM, you will select the shapes and choose which operations you want to perform. For example, if you are cutting out letters, you will need to use CAM to cut out each letter. You will also need to tell it how far to cut. It doesn\u2019t know anything about the material, so if you\u2019re cutting through 10mm ply or 5mm ply, you need to tell it so it doesn\u2019t over cut (too much). You also haven\u2019t told the machine how fast or deep to cut. There are many different settings related to the cutting (for example, how fast to \u201cplunge\u201d or dive into the material, how fast to move through the material, what kind of pattern to use when cutting out a pocket). Each material, each machine, and each bit will require a different set of parameters for how fast to move material, how many passes to take, and how deep you can go on each pass. There is a real art to making good CAM. Knowing your machine and making lots of test cuts can make a lot of difference in total time spent, and output quality. After CAM understands everything you want it to do, it will make a g-code file. The g-code file is a list of instructions for the Controller. It is important that the instructions are compatible with the controller you have. If you bought a controller from V1Engineering\u2019s shop, then it is running Marlin, and the CAM software needs to be configured to output g-code files compatible with the Marlin controller. There is a lot more detailed information in the Milling Basics , Estlcam Basics , and Estlcam 2.5D . Warning Fusion 360 does have CAM built in, and there is a Post processor available for it. It works great, but Fusion 360 CAM can be confusing, and it is highly recommended to start with Estlcam first. Even if you decide to later use the Fusion 360 CAM, the skills learned with Estlcam will be easier to learn, and will directly apply to any CAM software.","title":"Toolpath Generation/CAM"},{"location":"learn/software_overview/#g-code-sender","text":"The term \u201cG-code Sender\u201d isn\u2019t a very technical term, because there are so many ways to \u201cplay back\u201d a g-code file. A g-code file is just a list of instructions, with one instruction on each line. These need to be played back, one after another, so that the controller knows what to do. In addition to playback of g-code files, this software also does some basic setup. It needs to be able to send \u201cjog\u201d commands, which just move the machine around in one direction at a time. And it also needs to be able to set the \u201czero\u201d location to set up the cut. In dual endstop machines, it should also be able to command the homing sequence (Most CNC machines don\u2019t need endstops like 3D printers because the start location is on the workpiece, not the machine). The simplest method to do this is with Repetier-Host . The other simple method is to also install an LCD screen on the controller, which will take an SD card. You can put the file on the SD card, and set the whole thing up on the LCD, and play the file without bringing a computer into the shop. There are many other advanced ways to send gcode.

Obviously this is done by the tool at the end of the gantry, but it is facilitated by the controller. The controller takes movement commands, and drives the motors.

If the MPCNC is not big enough for you this picks up where that left off. Key Points \u00b6 Most parts can be 3D printed. To save from shipping or printing large parts the machine can be partially assembled to cut them itself. Easily Removable from the table for storage or portability. Inexpensive hardware store conduit is the recommended X rail. Rails ranging from 23.4mm to 25.4mm will work. This saves considerable cost over the LR2. Many tool options, in terms of functionality and brands. Blank DIY mount files are available. Full Y and Z axis squaring, leveling, and Z probing are available for excellent precision and accuracy. Works with any 5 driver board. 4 driver boards can be used but some automation, one axis dual endstops, will be lost. Can be used with Marlin, RepRap firmware, GRBL, FluidNC, or others. Geometry \u00b6 This CNC router can handle any length (within reason), the Y direction is only bound by your table length. The single Y rail keeps the machine properly constrained while maintaining ease of use. Two rails are extremely difficult to align, and fully constrained rails do not allow for easy removal of the machine. Width (X axis or \u201cBeam\u201d) should always be the shorter axis. The Z direction (height) is best kept to 80mm. This allows for 1.5\u201d of cutting depth, that is a lot. If you need to cut more than 1.5\u201d deep this is not the CNC for you. Now if you need to cut a few millimeters off really thick material (facing a slab), this can be a great machine for that. You want to keep the machine as low as possible and make the table surface adjustable, drop table. This keeps the Material Removal Rate very high. The answer is not making a taller machine. This router is most rigid when working near the table surface, opposite of most conventional gantry CNC machines. So the lower the axis the more rigid the machine.

Again here, rigidity is key. \u00bd\u201d (12mm) MDF is a great choice. Much thicker than that and you will need to clearance some for the coupler. At 16.5mm and thicker you will need to counter bore for the M5 nuts or get longer screws. YZ Plate DXF Mirrored set YZ Plate DXF , just to make it easy to mill up a set. YZ Plate STL , If you want to try and print it. XZ Plates \u00b6 The printed XZ plates (when printed in PLA) prove to be more rigid than \u00bd\u201d MDF. The only way to get any more rigidity is going to metal. If you choose to make your own, here are the guidelines. The M5 screws provided with the kit can handle up to 9.5mm thick plates and anything less than that. Anything above and you will need to counter bore the heads. The M3 screws provided with the kit need 6.35mm to 7mm plate thickness. If you go thinner you will needs washers, to go thicker you will need to counter bore the heads.

Assembly \u00b6 Core Assembly \u00b6 LR Core, and six M5 nuts. Press these 6 nuts in place. If they are not snug, use some loctite or glue to keep them in place, or mount your tool mount now loosely. The 7 th hole is a spare for future expansion packs. Bolts, 6082RS bearings and nuts for the next step. Snug up these 6 bolts and make sure everything still moves freely. These last two bolts control how much tension the core has on the Beam. Lightly seat these nuts and wait to set the tension until you have the beam ready. Get your Micro switch ready along with some M2.5 screws. Notice the lever orientation. Lightly set the M2.5 screws. If they strip out, add a drop of glue or thread locker to the threads and they should stay seated when it dries. X Drive \u00b6 This section uses the X Stepper Mount, M5\u2019s, and Idlers. Assemble as shown with the nuts down, very lightly seating the nuts. The inside nut fits in a small groove in the printed part. Make sure the Idlers spin freely. Add the pulley to the stepper 1-2mm up from the base. Tighten the flat grub screw first and then the next. Threadlocker or LocTite is recommended. Assure the pulley is centered with the idlers when assembled. Make sure to orient the wire out, as shown. Snug the stepper in place with M3\u2019s Add the stepper assembly to the Core. Make sure the M5\u2019s engage the nuts properly, If there is any sign of binding, back out and try again. If for some reason the nuts spin, use a small flat head screw driver to pin it in place as you tighten. Snugged in place. Tuck the wires into the groove and you can secure them at the top with a wire or cable tie. Now is a good time to add your touch plate wires if you are using one. If you are concerned you can add a piece of tape in between the screw holes but any tool mount should also do the trick here. Soon this part is going to be buried behind a router and a hose, so admire it now. Looks good, right?! Side Plate Assemblies \u00b6 Z drives, steppers, M3 screws. Pay attention to wire routing here. Snug up the M3 Screws Y drives, Idlers, M5\u2019s Seated, not snug. Screws are axles here. Nuts facing down. Make sure idlers are very free to spin. Add the pulley to the stepper. 1-2mm gap next picture has a visual check. Tighten the grub screw on the flat shaft surface first then the other screw. LocTite is recommend on all grub screws. Make sure the pulley teeth are centered with the idlers. Snug The stepper in place with the M3 Screws. Wires should face one in each direction (mirrored), just like the Y drives. Microswitches, M2.5 screws. Make sure the lever faces out (up in this picture). Switch away from the stepper wires, route wires together (for now). Gentle with the tiny screws threading into the printed part. Seated, no more. If you do happen to strip out the screw holes, a drop of nearly any glue or LocTite on the threads will fix it. Orientation, mirrored sets. Z Stop & Z Stop M, wired endstops, M2.5mm screws. Notice the direction of the switch levers Tuck the wires nicely into the grove and make sure not to pinch them when installing them later. Gentle with the small M2.5 screws. T8 nut, and 1-2 M3 screws. In the following steps, you will either be using the printed XZ plates, or XZ lead screw stubs. One screw is plenty as it is just there to stop the brass nut from spinning. A completed XZ printed plate. With milled XZ plates, you will need to attach the stubs to the plate with an M5. The nuts gets seated in the printed stub. Align the angled surfaces of both parts. Orientation of the stubs and XZ plates. The MGN12H bearing blocks get attached to the XZ plate. If you are using the printed version, M3x10mm screws will fit. If you are using a milled part follow the guidelines for thickness. Only use washers if necessary. Now is a good time to assure the linear guides are moving freely. If not, loosen the 4 small screws on the end of the bearing block a full turn. Move the bearing block back and forth and tighten the screws back up. You can add a touch of a light oil or dab of the superlube, but it should not be necessary. Keep the stops in the end until they are mounted to the YZ plates to avoid tiny bearings everywhere. With the rails mounted, make sure they are parallel by measuring how far apart they are at the top and bottom of travel at the ends. Snug up the M3\u2019s. LocTite is not a bad idea here. You will need to add three M5\u2019s to the holes shown here. Actually, you only need the lower two, but just to be safe drop them all in for now. Use the small wood screws to attach the rails to the YZ plate. Start attaching the rails in the middle, one screw each. Loosely. Once you have a screw in each rail you can remove the stops. Keep adding screws and checking for smooth motion as you go. The hole in the XZ plate is there to let you access the middle screw. If all is going well, snug up the wood screws into the YZ plate. Gentle here. Do not strip out the MDF/wood. It doesn\u2019t take much. Add the Z drive wires facing the back. Use M5 screws here and snug it up a bit. Z End Stop \u00b6 Attach Z Stop & Z Stop M parts with M5 screws and nuts. Test to make sure the micro switch clicks before the XZ plate hits the top. If not, the printed parts are vertically slotted to allow Z stop height to be adjusted, and/or can bend the microswitch arm to adjust. IF bending, ensure the switch\u2019s tiny trigger still functions, so, bend the arm at the kinky end. The endstop wires will run through a small slot in the Y drive. Make sure they are free to move and not pinched. Keeping the printed parts aligned with the plates keeps it looking nice. Make sure the screws are snug so the switches do not move. Insert the Y drive. It goes in with a 90 degree twist. Should be plenty of room when XZ plate is moved aside, just. Caution: XZ plate doubles as a finger guillotine as the assembly weight increases throughout the build. Make sure the endstop wires are free moving. Snug the screws. Wire routing, each side should run towards the back of the plate. Cable tie points on the Y and Z drives. Wire sleeve is optional, but looks nice here. Or, leave them exposed to make it look more complicated to your audience. Everyone loves a person with a big brain. Wheels \u00b6 608rs and bolts, Bearing Wheel Bracket Front & Rear. Preferred \u201cwheels\u201d Seat the bolt so the head and nut are making contact, but do not tighten. This is just an axle. Pay attention to the bolt orientation. The nut goes in the deeper side. Optional Wheel brackets Link Use spacers to prevent over tightening Seat the bolt, but no need to over-snug it. Wheels installed; bolts in, nuts out. Snug these four screws. Rail Rollers \u00b6 Front and Rear Rail Roller, bolts and bearings. Insert the bearings, and seat the bolts. No need to snug as these are just axles. Bolt orientation is important here. One bolt is facing up and the nuts is tricky to slide into the top. Side Plates are done! Roll them around on your table making motor noises to make sure they work right. Beam Assembly \u00b6 If you already have your strut plates cut, use this as a loose guide. Install the strut plates loosely at first to get everything aligned then go back and snug them all up. Install the strut plates in this order; front face (with top and bottom rail clamping), bottom, and sloped back (with the optional vac hose hangers). Building the beam includes the X rails, braces (optionally two with higher infill for the ends), temporary strut plates, and a lot of M5\u2019s. Fit your rail together. Make sure the end two plates have a top printed surface facing out. This makes for a more perfect mating surface as mesh bed leveling can leave an odd surface on the bottom. Sliding the braces on your rail is preferred over snapping them in. This keeps a sharp clamp tip. Next step is to add the front temporary strut plates. Remember, initially you will be leaving the screws loose. Roughly space the rest of the braces equally down the beam. Loosely add the rest of the front screws, lightly engaging the Nyloc just so they do not fall out while making these first cuts. Very loosely add the bottom screws, again, lightly engaging the Nyloc. Now add the rear temporary strut plates and optionally, the hose hangers. You can snug up the temp plate screws and the hose hanger screws. If you lay the beam on its face as shown in this picture you can tell if the beam is twisted or not. Now go back and snug up the front clamps. The key here is just lightly engaged, There will be a gap , and the rails will be able to spin if you try. The clamps do not do very much other than account for slight rail size differences. Do not over tighten. The only catch here is make sure the screw faces make contact and the nuts make contact with the printed part. It is possible to thread the screw in and the nuts not actually be all the way in, eventually they would loosen up. You can thread the screw all the way in and keep turning to lightly ream out the screw hole if needed before adding the nuts. Add the LR-Core to the beam and set the tension of the lower two bolts. Too loose and the core can move and you will hear bearings clicking on the rails. Too tight and you will feel the LR-Core hesitate over each brace. More is not better here. Typically, little to no extra tension is needed and it is best just to seat the nuts gently. Last check is to make sure the X rails do not stick out further than the braces, at least on the bottom rail. You can add the side plates using the 6 screws. Snug these up. Make sure both sides move up and down pretty freely, as long as gravity pulls them all The way down you are good to go here. Measure the heel and toe distances across your machine, make sure they are equal. If not adjust the end clamps. Best practice is to make robot noises while you move it up and down (feel free to tag me in your video when you do #V1LR3). X Belt \u00b6 Run your X belt through the X Drive. It is a good idea to run it as shown and cut it when you know exactly how long to make it. To secure the ends you can make a small fold, or use a 4-5 tooth cutoff, and pull it back into the slot. Just make sure it does not interfere with the YZ plate when you move the Z axis all the way up. Leave a bit of room to pull it out if needed. For the X tensioner, insert belt through the side, then loop around and back on itself (out the side again) to set the length. If you have a hard time getting this right, you can draw a little line on the top of your belt to see which way you need to go. Each tooth is two millimeters (1/16\u201d), so it is very easy to adjust. Make sure to seat the nut into the tensioner. Add the X tensioner to the XZ plate and set the tension just below where it makes a sound when you pluck it. Make sure to leave ~4mm (\u215b\u201c) or more gap between the plate and tensioner to adjust this later if needed. Add your tool mount of choice. Snug up the vacuum side of the mount and leave the stepper side loose. This is the side you will always use to set the tension. Make sure the wires are free to move behind the mount and not pinched. Stand back and admire what you have accomplished. Feel free to get a loved one or neighbor and tell them you designed the entire thing from scratch. Y Rail \u00b6 The calculator dimensions are for edge to edge table use. If you added extra width divide it by two and place your \u201cFront Y Belt Holder Base Right\u201d. From there the edge of your Rail blocks get placed 61.75mm in from that, that line gets followed all the way down the rail. I pre-drill all the rail block holes in the center to have some adjustment if needed. The center of the rail block slots are 44.7mm in from the line set in the previous step for a total of 106.45mm in from the edge of your Y belt block. Place the rail blocks no further than 200mm (8\u201d) apart. You can measure out the other Y belt holder block or wait to use the fully assembled machine to mark it with the Y drive. The Y drives are flush with the rail blocks. Another view of that. Place the Y tension bases inline with the front blocks and far enough in to act as a hard stop not to drive your machine of the edge of the table. 30mm in from the edge is good. More in from the edge (88mm) if you do not want your hose holders to moves past the edge of the able. Wire Routing \u00b6 SKR Pro Info Rambo / Mini Info Wire routing is pretty free form with lots of options. Here is how I do it. If you have not cut your strut plates yet you will have a chance to revisit the wiring or you can route it so you do not have to remove it at all. Labeling your wires is great idea. For more specific wiring info please see the \u201cControl\u201d tab in the main menu, and then select your board. Be sure to tape or secure any connections. I find it best to start by running the shortest wire first. You can see how the Z endstop and Y stepper wires are ran down and secured. The wires then run under the Z stepper and get secured again. The extensions will be needed for the wires on the rail side. You can route the wires around the back and into the hose holders (easy to work with later). Or you can run the wires into the beam and secure them in there. Make sure you have full range of Z motion and the wires don\u2019t catch anywhere. Full shot of the wires ran and the excess folded over in the hose holders. The X axis wires need to have full range of motion so that means securing them just short of the half way point. I temporarily added the power supply on the wire bundle. After the strut plates are cut, I prefer to mount it inside the beam. Now you can add the lead screws. Make sure the Z axis has full range of motion and does not hit the coupler when at the bottom of motion. Y Belt \u00b6 When running the Y belts Feed the belt through the Y drive and secure into the front blocks first. Loop the belt over with enough room to remove it later if needed. The rear blocks get a nut inserted and are quick release and adjustable. The right tension is tight, but just before it starts to sound like a bass guitar, if plucked. You should be able to remove the block still as well. If you have a way to check, 6-10lbs tension is what you\u2019re looking for. Rear block assembled. Now do the other side. You nervous yet? It is time to fire it up! No need to make your own noises anymore, the machine will do it for you. See, I thought of everything! Getting Started, cutting your strut plates \u00b6 At this point you should be able to power up and give your build a little test move. Depending on how your machine is built, you can use your control screen, repetier host, other software over USB, or over the air. Here is a quick overview of a basic movement test . Initial Squaring \u00b6 To square the machine you need to mark 4 points and measure the diagonal. This is how we set the Y axis homing to square the machine relative to the rail. You will probably need to repeat this a couple times to get it under 1mm difference. You can cable tie a pen to the vacuum mount as shown below, or here is a pen mount that fits on most router bodies. V1 Printables You can also automate this process with Jamie\u2019s \u201cSquareness Marks\u201d test. * Start with G92 X0 Y0 Z0 - Check this box and where the pen tip is will be 0,0,0. I suggest starting the pen just above the paper. * Z level for pen-down - Make this number more negative if you find some of your marks are not hitting the paper, but you want as light a touch as possible. * Z level for pen-up - You can go as high as you need to not drag the pen tip. * Feedrate - This is set at a safe travel rate. * Extents - This is where you set the dimensions of your table. The further apart the marks the more accurate your table will be. I use tape, so I can be sure I am using the correct mark. Home the X and Y axis. Use the Z axis to mark a small dot at 0,0. Now drive the machine to your X axis furthest point (or very close to it). Use the Z to mark the dot. Drive to the Y extreme and repeat the process for the back two corners. Now measure the diagonals to the best of your ability. Note the longer one, and subtract to find the difference. Under 1mm is very good. If you are over 1mm in difference you can use the terminal on your SKR Pro or a USB connection and repetier host to add a homing offset. \u201cM666 Y0.5\u201d will move your Y1 stepper 0.5mm away from the stop block after it homes. \u201cM666 Y-0.5\u201d will move your Y2 stepper away instead. You want to move the longer dimension side away from the block. A good first guess is the difference in your measurements (or you can use a trig calculator and add a bit because your end stops are further away than the dots). Now Use \u201cM500\u201d to save it to the EEPROM. Re-home X and Y and test it again. Z Leveling \u00b6 Z leveling is a bit easier than the Y axis if you have a touch plate. You can also use any sort of block or piece of paper as a feeler gauge. We are only looking for the difference here. Home all three of your axis. Touch plate - If you are using the touch plate, you probe by using G38.2 Z0. When it gets there, take note of the current Z position. Then move it up and over to your X axis extreme and probe again, taking note of the Z axis position. Take the difference and adjust the side that moved furthest. Feeler Gauge - You will drive your Z axis down until you just make contact with the touch plate and take note of the current Z axis position. Repeat this for the other end of the X axis. Take the difference and adjust the side that moved furthest. You adjust by running \u201cM666 Z0.5\u201d the number is in millimeters. Save with M500 after each adjustment home all axis and start check your work. These numbers are counting down from 200, so 120 is further away than than 130. Start by adjusting 0.2mm more than your difference. Making the Strut plates \u00b6 At this point you should be ready to make some cuts. To be certain it all goes as planned, you can make a test cut in high density foam, or simply making an air cut. To make an air cut you, just home your machine above the table and run the gcode. This lets you watch that it moves as you would expect it to and doesn\u2019t snag or have any faults in the code. Basic software setup Basic CAM settings Gcode making - TODO The three strut plates should be 6.35mm (\u00bc\u201c) or thinner MDF or similarly rigid material. You will want to cut each plate as close to the side of your build as you can to assure your build has the rigidity to do so. Getting ready to make your first cuts all starts with loading the material. Make sure the edge is behind your Endmill in the Y direction and parallel with the edge in the X direction. Checking the front and back edges relative to the table. (To the rail would be a more proper measurement) Secure the material and make sure your means will not interfere with the core as it passes over. I use screws with large heads. This is what a finished cut looks like. All parts are held in place with small tabs of material that can be cut with a saw or utility knife. Do this two more times. Disassembly \u00b6 Final Assembly \u00b6 Measure the heel and toe distances across your machine, make sure they are equal. If not adjust the end clamps. Problems can arrise if your rails are too long after you install the strut plates. Vacuum \u00b6 Size, options, routing, grounding. *to do Quick release coupler for 1.5\u201d hose. Using the machine. \u00b6 Firmware \u00b6 Dual endstop LowRider \u201cDualLR\u201d firmware recommended for ultimate accuracy and precision. This requires at least a 5 driver control board. This allows you to align the Y axis and Z axis using dual endstops. The standard MPCNC firmware will work with any board on the LowRider if you are not using endstops or wired in series (using a 4 driver board). You will just use hardstops like the LR2 did.

The single Y rail keeps the machine properly constrained while maintaining ease of use. Two rails are extremely difficult to align, and fully constrained rails do not allow for easy removal of the machine. Width (X axis or \u201cBeam\u201d) should always be the shorter axis. The Z direction (height) is best kept to 80mm. This allows for 1.5\u201d of cutting depth, that is a lot. If you need to cut more than 1.5\u201d deep this is not the CNC for you. Now if you need to cut a few millimeters off really thick material (facing a slab), this can be a great machine for that. You want to keep the machine as low as possible and make the table surface adjustable, drop table. This keeps the Material Removal Rate very high. The answer is not making a taller machine.

Install the strut plates loosely at first to get everything aligned then go back and snug them all up. Install the strut plates in this order; front face (with top and bottom rail clamping), bottom, and sloped back (with the optional vac hose hangers). Building the beam includes the X rails, braces (optionally two with higher infill for the ends), temporary strut plates, and a lot of M5\u2019s. Fit your rail together. Make sure the end two plates have a top printed surface facing out. This makes for a more perfect mating surface as mesh bed leveling can leave an odd surface on the bottom. Sliding the braces on your rail is preferred over snapping them in. This keeps a sharp clamp tip. Next step is to add the front temporary strut plates. Remember, initially you will be leaving the screws loose. Roughly space the rest of the braces equally down the beam. Loosely add the rest of the front screws, lightly engaging the Nyloc just so they do not fall out while making these first cuts. Very loosely add the bottom screws, again, lightly engaging the Nyloc. Now add the rear temporary strut plates and optionally, the hose hangers. You can snug up the temp plate screws and the hose hanger screws. If you lay the beam on its face as shown in this picture you can tell if the beam is twisted or not. Now go back and snug up the front clamps. The key here is just lightly engaged, There will be a gap , and the rails will be able to spin if you try. The clamps do not do very much other than account for slight rail size differences. Do not over tighten. The only catch here is make sure the screw faces make contact and the nuts make contact with the printed part. It is possible to thread the screw in and the nuts not actually be all the way in, eventually they would loosen up. You can thread the screw all the way in and keep turning to lightly ream out the screw hole if needed before adding the nuts. Add the LR-Core to the beam and set the tension of the lower two bolts. Too loose and the core can move and you will hear bearings clicking on the rails. Too tight and you will feel the LR-Core hesitate over each brace. More is not better here. Typically, little to no extra tension is needed and it is best just to seat the nuts gently. Last check is to make sure the X rails do not stick out further than the braces, at least on the bottom rail. You can add the side plates using the 6 screws. Snug these up. Make sure both sides move up and down pretty freely, as long as gravity pulls them all The way down you are good to go here.

Just make sure it does not interfere with the YZ plate when you move the Z axis all the way up. Leave a bit of room to pull it out if needed. For the X tensioner, insert belt through the side, then loop around and back on itself (out the side again) to set the length.

Labeling your wires is great idea. For more specific wiring info please see the \u201cControl\u201d tab in the main menu, and then select your board. Be sure to tape or secure any connections. I find it best to start by running the shortest wire first. You can see how the Z endstop and Y stepper wires are ran down and secured. The wires then run under the Z stepper and get secured again. The extensions will be needed for the wires on the rail side. You can route the wires around the back and into the hose holders (easy to work with later). Or you can run the wires into the beam and secure them in there. Make sure you have full range of Z motion and the wires don\u2019t catch anywhere. Full shot of the wires ran and the excess folded over in the hose holders. The X axis wires need to have full range of motion so that means securing them just short of the half way point. I temporarily added the power supply on the wire bundle. After the strut plates are cut, I prefer to mount it inside the beam. Now you can add the lead screws. Make sure the Z axis has full range of motion and does not hit the coupler when at the bottom of motion.","title":"Wire Routing"},{"location":"lowrider/#y-belt","text":"When running the Y belts Feed the belt through the Y drive and secure into the front blocks first.

This is how we set the Y axis homing to square the machine relative to the rail. You will probably need to repeat this a couple times to get it under 1mm difference. You can cable tie a pen to the vacuum mount as shown below, or here is a pen mount that fits on most router bodies. V1 Printables You can also automate this process with Jamie\u2019s \u201cSquareness Marks\u201d test. * Start with G92 X0 Y0 Z0 - Check this box and where the pen tip is will be 0,0,0. I suggest starting the pen just above the paper. * Z level for pen-down - Make this number more negative if you find some of your marks are not hitting the paper, but you want as light a touch as possible. * Z level for pen-up - You can go as high as you need to not drag the pen tip. * Feedrate - This is set at a safe travel rate. * Extents - This is where you set the dimensions of your table. The further apart the marks the more accurate your table will be. I use tape, so I can be sure I am using the correct mark. Home the X and Y axis. Use the Z axis to mark a small dot at 0,0. Now drive the machine to your X axis furthest point (or very close to it). Use the Z to mark the dot. Drive to the Y extreme and repeat the process for the back two corners. Now measure the diagonals to the best of your ability. Note the longer one, and subtract to find the difference. Under 1mm is very good. If you are over 1mm in difference you can use the terminal on your SKR Pro or a USB connection and repetier host to add a homing offset. \u201cM666 Y0.5\u201d will move your Y1 stepper 0.5mm away from the stop block after it homes. \u201cM666 Y-0.5\u201d will move your Y2 stepper away instead. You want to move the longer dimension side away from the block. A good first guess is the difference in your measurements (or you can use a trig calculator and add a bit because your end stops are further away than the dots).

Then move it up and over to your X axis extreme and probe again, taking note of the Z axis position. Take the difference and adjust the side that moved furthest. Feeler Gauge - You will drive your Z axis down until you just make contact with the touch plate and take note of the current Z axis position. Repeat this for the other end of the X axis. Take the difference and adjust the side that moved furthest. You adjust by running \u201cM666 Z0.5\u201d the number is in millimeters.

This CNC router can handle any length (within reason), the Y direction is only bound by your table length. Width (X direction on rails) should always be the shorter axis and is recommended to keep the work area no larger than 4\u2032 on this axis. The Z direction (height) is best kept to a 3-4\u2033 maximum for wood, with that being said, you can make the usable z length as much as you want you will be working from the bottom up, so go to town. Calculator for table, rail, and belt lengths. Version 1 Version one instructions are here Assembly \u00b6 All quantities shown in the drawings are for each assembly, not total quantities. Center Assembly \u00b6 The VacDuct, sits inside the router clamp body to separate the router exhaust and the vacuum intake. When setting the tension for the X Mounts after attaching them to the plate set the tension for each mount individually. An easy way is to use the Z rail and run it through each one, very light tension, you might not even need to add any, the mounts are interference fit. Z Assemblies \u00b6 Check for correct orientation of XZ Main and XZ. Stepper mounting hole in XZ Main, pointy side should face outward (facing away from the table). Belt mounting hole on XZ should face inward (Facing the table).See pictures for details. When fully assembled the XZ main\u2019s should sit completely flat on the YZ rollers. If not check these three points. Double check that the Z rails are parallel, same distance apart at the bottom as they are on the top. If you loosen the corner brackets up too much and the XZ mains still won\u2019t sit flat the larger bolts are not tensioned properly / evenly (probably way way too much). Make sure all four notches are above the end of the Z rails. The XZ & XZ_side should be installed with an equal gap on all four screws. There should be a gap of a few millimeters equally on each side of the corners to the XZ Main. These parts can alter the Z rail angles so care is needed. They do not need to be extremely tight; a little pressure goes a long way. This is how these couplers should be used. The coupler should not be compressed, if anything a little stretch to make sure the lead screw is in contact with the stepper shaft. This prevents bouncing. The lead screw should be only inserted as far as the coupler bottom collar. This lets the stepper shaft and lead screw to move for any minor misalignment. Seat the grub screws on the shaft trying to get the straightest connection possible. If you hit an edge it will get wonky just give it a little turn and try again. On the stepper shaft tighten the flat screw first then the one that hits the round surface. Do not forget to lube the Z lead screws. There is a small notch / ridge to prevent the Z rails from coming out of the top on all 4 parts. If your rails are crooked this is where to check. Sides \u00b6 It is best not to tighten the M3 screws all the way on the T8 nuts. This allows for a touch of misalignment and smoother Z action. Don\u2019t worry, their only job is to stop rotation and gravity does the rest. Belts \u00b6 Belt Insert \u00b6 Why? The cable_tie_insert was made to eliminate the flex and bounce of the cable tie and belt connection. This will help keep a reasonable arc in the cable tie at the belt end provided you use the clasp end as shown and the belt flat. This should eliminate cable tie/belt flex on a properly tensioned belt and the tension should stay true longer. The other end of the cable tie connection is rounded internally on all printed parts with a similar arc. Using a few segments of the belt itself when securing the end ensures a better connection on the belts teeth. 3-4 teeth facing teeth up will make for a rounder surface of the cable tie that secures the folded belt. This will prevent a wide belt from cupping and slipping teeth. Belt Ends \u00b6 Table \u00b6 Use the dimensions from the calculator, make it as flat and square as you can. The edges guide the machine so those are important. I used some 2\u2033x3\u2033 and \u00bd\u2033 particle board on top. The X direction is more important to get flat than the Y direction, so build accordingly. Usually this means solid supports in The X direction. If you can picture it the machine and material can follow a subtle curve down the length much more so than the width. Note Ideal table thickness is 4\u2033 or less. Firmware \u00b6 The standard MPCNC firmware will work with any board on the LowRider2. Dual endstop firmware is not really needed since all three axis have hard stops you can use for alignment. Firmware page. For the creative of you, you could use the dual end stop firmware for Y alignment or even Z (homing min or max). Hose Channel \u00b6 I use 1.5\u2033-2\u2033 aluminum angle with a few Velcro straps to keep the hose and cords contained. Bigger or smaller works depending on the hose size you use. Getting Started \u00b6 Using the machine. \u00b6 1) Square it up. After mounting your work piece (making sure the mounting hardware is not going to interfere) I check to make sure the sides (Assemblies with the wheels on them) are the same distance from the nearest end. You can do this by making sure the wheels are hitting the stop blocks/belt mounts. 2) Double check. You only need to do this the first few times until you understand the machine. Use the LCD to control the machine. Lift the gantry high enough as to not drag the bit across your material. Drive the machine the entire length of what you will be cutting. This is to make sure the machine does not hit the table and you are parallel with it. Another way to do this is include an outline in your design and use it as your fist tool path above your material. This is to make sure nothing binds or hits. 3) Set your starting position. Use the lcd to position the bit at your zero position in all three axis. 4) Beginning gcode. If you use the Fusion 360 post processor this is done for you but make sure your beginning gcode resets all your axis to 0,0,0 , you can use this command, G92 X0 Y0 Z0 . 5) Ending gcode. What should happen is your job ends above your last position, meaning your bit should not drag across the surface if you move it. With the bit above the last position, telling the machine to go back to the starting position will return the machine to where you started it and then making sure the steppers do not turn off is a good idea as the LowRider will drop under its own weight. The last few lines of your gcode should look like this. G1 Z7 F400 (this is my clearance plane and is already in my gcode) G1 X0 Y0 F2100 (I add this to have the machine drive itself back to the start) At this point you can use the lcd to move the machine clear of your material and lower it, then power off. Or, if you leave a little room you can drive past your starting point and lower automatically. G1 Z7 F400 (already there) G1 X-15 Y-15 F2100 (drive 15mm past your start) G1 Z0 F400 (Lower the machine) M84; Turn steppers off","title":"LR2 Assembly"},{"location":"lowrider/lrv2/indexv2/#low-rider-cnc-2","text":"The LowRider2 CNC is my revised version of a CNC router that can handle full sheet material!

After mounting your work piece (making sure the mounting hardware is not going to interfere) I check to make sure the sides (Assemblies with the wheels on them) are the same distance from the nearest end. You can do this by making sure the wheels are hitting the stop blocks/belt mounts. 2) Double check. You only need to do this the first few times until you understand the machine. Use the LCD to control the machine. Lift the gantry high enough as to not drag the bit across your material. Drive the machine the entire length of what you will be cutting. This is to make sure the machine does not hit the table and you are parallel with it. Another way to do this is include an outline in your design and use it as your fist tool path above your material. This is to make sure nothing binds or hits. 3) Set your starting position. Use the lcd to position the bit at your zero position in all three axis. 4) Beginning gcode. If you use the Fusion 360 post processor this is done for you but make sure your beginning gcode resets all your axis to 0,0,0 , you can use this command, G92 X0 Y0 Z0 . 5) Ending gcode. What should happen is your job ends above your last position, meaning your bit should not drag across the surface if you move it. With the bit above the last position, telling the machine to go back to the starting position will return the machine to where you started it and then making sure the steppers do not turn off is a good idea as the LowRider will drop under its own weight. The last few lines of your gcode should look like this. G1 Z7 F400 (this is my clearance plane and is already in my gcode) G1 X0 Y0 F2100 (I add this to have the machine drive itself back to the start) At this point you can use the lcd to move the machine clear of your material and lower it, then power off.

You can edit the CAD to suit your specific build and get the exact dimensions or DXF files from there. CAD files are available here Once you get that choice sorted out, the most important step is getting it as square as you can. Measuring the diagonals and comparing them is the easiest way to check for square, in a cube there are 16 diagonals to check. Get them as accurate as you feel you need. Common Components \u00b6 Depending on your frame choice, some of the hardware will vary. Mounting things to 20 series extrusions typically requires M3x8mm screws, flat parts require wood, plastic, or metal screws that are 5mm longer than needed. Threaded inserts are available, press fit or heat set. Corners \u00b6 Best to start by threading all the M5 nuts onto the screws to loosen up the lock nuts. Do this for all M5\u2019s. Lube the Idlers (all idlers), Super lube is nice but others will work. Insert the nuts into the corner parts. Assemble with the idlers. Tighten the screws enough to assure the nuts are seated, then back off. Make sure the idlers still have free play on the screws. Mount the corners with your frame screws. Snug. This picture is using press fit inserts so machine screws are used. Make sure the frame is still square. Hub \u00b6 Optional, lube the V-Wheels. A trick for inserting the nuts is to thread them on backwards and tap them into place. Tighten all the screws to assure the nuts are seated and back off. The screw that jumps the gap controls tension - only thread this until it just hits the nyloc. You will adjust the tension just before printing. These enstops must match this style or the triggers will not line up. M3x10mm screws. Add the Endstop, in the orientation shown, Lightly snug the screws, do not strip the plastic. If you do strip the holes, loctite or superglue works to fix them. Rail \u00b6 Cut the rail to the length required in your CAD version. Aluminum or Carbon Fiber. Cut it a millimeter long and sand it to a precise length for easier assembly. Round the ends for ease of assembly. Avoid Carbon Fiber dust if using this as your rail. Add the Hub, assure easy smooth rolling. Make sure it is not too tight as this can cause flat spots. You can rotate the tube 90 degrees to see if one way fits better. Trucks \u00b6 Make sure the M5\u2019s are pre-threaded. Nut trick for ease of assembly. Lube the idlers. Notice the position of the smooth idlers, they will face the steppers. One high one low. Very loosely assemble the trucks. They will be used for clamping in a later step. Truck Triggers \u00b6 This truck will get two triggers. The other truck has none. The trigger position relative to the smooth idler is important. This is the left / main truck. A small locking piece 4 teeth long and a ~30mm piece is a good starting point for the lower trigger (X axis). See which way the teeth face. Insert from the back side, small locking piece at the end. Pull the belt through and make sure it is seated. Later you will trim this to fit. Add the Y axis trigger. This uses a 3 tooth locking piece. If your trigger is loose, use 3.5 teeth. Make sure it is fully inserted. Core XY \u00b6 Notice the small Truck Spacers, they go in the middle. (Shown in the next picture). Left / Main truck and right with M3x10mm screws. The left truck gets mounted high (middle and bottom screw positions). The right gets low (middle and high positions). The three screws on the same part get snugged up, the 4 th screw gets lightly seated to allow for some movement if needed. Try to make sure the 3 screw half is mounted squarely. Compare the truck and idler positions, as well as the Hub direction. Press fit the pieces. Slide the assembly into your frame and secure the rails with your frame screws. Check to make sure the rails are as parallel as possible. You can measure from the rail to the top of the frame, 20mm difference between sides. You can now lightly seat the truck M5 screws on the rail, ensure the Gap is equal front and back. Lightly, too tight and you can actually crack the rail. Note You can actually twist the rail with the truck screws. Using a flat reference across the top of your build you can measure your extruder to assure it is not twisting on the rail. If it is adjust opposite screws to twist the rail. Example - Tighten the front screw on the left and back screw on the right and the extruder will now slightly move up from as it moves from left to right (if the rail was level initially). Stepper Mounts \u00b6 Grub screws and loctite go hand in hand. Loose grub screws are the #1 issue in all the V1 builds. Use a piece of belt as a spacer for the pulley. Do a test fit to make sure the pulley is just a bit above the bottom surface as show. Secure the steppers with M3x10 screws. I mount them with four of the wires facing up, one down. Four get endstops. All four endstops are mounted in this orientation. I like to run and secure the wires as shown, for now. Mount the steppers with your frame screws. The mount with the wire down goes in Z2, the lower right stepper, shown in the next picture. Belting the Gantry \u00b6 This is the best picture I could come up with. Low belt shown tight, high belt shown loose. Feed the belt in from the hub and work your way around. No twists, no crossing. Cut the belt leaving 30mm or so on each end when pulled snug. You can trim it further later. lock the belt in the front with a 4 tooth segment. Pull it in and make sure it is at least flush if not a bit further in. The Belt Tugger gets locked with a 4 tooth segment. Seat the nut. Okay, this part is fiddly. It might take a few tries to get right. Feed the belt through and pull it snug. You can use pliers. The lock, when fully inserted, will loosen up 2mm. It sinks in a bit. Make sure the lock is fully seated. Trim the belts a bit, leave a little room in case you need to snug them up later. Insert the screw. Try to get both belts lightly tensioned and equal. Measure the coreXY diagonals from the back corners to the trucks to make sure it is square. Adjusting the belt tension will change the angle of the X axis rail. Give the belt a little tug to see which way the rails angles. Z axis X3 \u00b6 Go ahead and mount all three rails. Take a few measurements as you can screw the them a bit if needed. Nice right!? I find it easiest to run the belt as I go, in the direction shown. Lube that idler. Assemble the idler into the Z idler part. Screw lightly seated. Assemble with the belt in place. This is the only belt that is hard to do after the fact (but it can be). Z Post. Seat the nuts. Mount the post with your frame screws. There should be a gap and the post should be square to the rail. Attach the Z idlers as loose as possible. At least to take a belt measurement later. Note It can be easier to take these off when setting or adjusting the belt tension on this axis. Cut the belt just short of touching the other end. Zbed Slider....my favorite part. Seat the nuts. For now add the spring and screw to hold the nut in place. Belt locks, 4 teeth long. Lock the bottom in place first. Now lock the top in place. You can remove the top idler braket to make this easier. A little trial and error is needed. The top idler can adjust up to 5mm of slack or more if you are not running wires on top. Make sure to cut the belt flush. Mount using M3x10mm screws. Adjust the belt tension to be equal in all three and not too tight. 3-3.5 teeth for the trigger locks. Make the triggers just long enough to not hit the bottom when fully lowered or they can stay bent. Make sure they are centered. Looking good right?!?

This is the MP3DP -V2- Milled/Printed 3D Printer Version 2 . This is a fun project to use your new CNC mill for. The V2 has tightened up some of the designs from my first version, every single part is different. Nothing too major. Better belt placement, better frame geometry, more robust parts, better extruder mount, easier to set home stops, slightly larger build volume, ability to use thicker material for the frame, optional bottom plate for rigidity, better smooth rod handling. This page \u00b6 If you just want to open a box and have a ready 3D printer there are a few solid options out there. The MP3DP V2 is a printer for those of you that want to build one, get your hands dirty, and learn a thing or two! Currently this is just a guide, not a full set of instructions.

All the parts can safely go above a little thicker than \u00bd\u2033 and as thin as you want for those of you with access to high tech materials. Material thickness will determine some screw lengths as outlined below. I have included a \u201cY Speed Plate\u201d for the ultimate bed support. I use insulation under my bed so I also included a full \u201cY Plate\u201d, also needed for you savages that use 4 corner heated bed mounting. Make sure only to cut the one you need as you do not need both. All inside corners were designed with \u215b\u2033 diameter or smaller end mills.

Belts \u00b6 I love me some cable ties\u2026 For the bed I tried something new, and I like it. Pass through the block and tension the other parts. Make sure the ends clear and do not hit the pulley or idler. Better alignment? GT2 Idlers \u00b6 I took a while to release these parts because my idlers kept seizing up. I have two suggestions, first lube them well, I am using the super lube from the shop, no issues since. Second belt tension does not have to be superhuman here. Start loose and only tighten the belts if you notice issues. Too tight=excessive ringing and premature idler damage, Too loose=soft rounded corners and poor wall consistency. X Axis \u00b6 Easy adjust, more consistent belt tension. Use the screws to set the smooth rods into place, or use super glue like before. They should be adjusted top and bottom, to 301mm. you can measure this top and bottom to ensure the ends are parallel. Wires \u00b6 If you need a good first printing project how about a box to hide those wires, Gnarly Mini-Rambo Case , or a case for the LCD ? Extruders \u00b6 I have designed this with both the Titan Aero , and the MK8 in mind they both work great choice is yours. The mounting plate is pretty straight forward the holes are easy enough to utilize for anything you might need if you don\u2019t like either of those. The holes are 64mm apart. Printed Parts \u00b6 Infill on the parts is not a big deal I use 15%-20%, but make sure to use 2-3 perimeter walls to keep the through hole support.

Hardware \u00b6 Here is a simplified hardware list, a few parts are made for shorter hardware, but this is as simple as it gets. You can also go longer on most all of these. M3.5mm is almost a direct fit for the #6-32 screws, some seem not to want to order these online if they can\u2019t find them locally so an M4 will probably work. I really suggest just ordering a box of M3.5\u2019s for simplicity. Qty Name Comment 3 #6-32 x 1.5\u2033 Hex heads. These are for the XYZ endstop adjustments. 60 #6-32 x ??(1\u2033) Frame screw length depends on frame material thickness, round up in length. See Below. 55 #6-32 Nylocs 20 M3 x 10mm Stepper and T8 nut screws 5 M3 x 22mm Bed adjustment and Idler screws 4 M3 Nylocs 3 Control Board screws mount screws,standoffs dependent on your board. e.g. (M3x22mm with 10mm rubber standoffs) 3 Power supply screws mount screws,standoffs dependent on your power supply. e.g.(M5 x 20mm 7mm rubber standoffs) The control board and power supply screws will depend on your hardware, frame thickness and preferred standoff distance, easy thing to do is cut rubber hose as the standoffs. Screw length \u00b6 This is the hard part. A \u00be\u2033 screw is a thread or two away from fitting a \u215c\u2033 frame board, counter sinking would make them fit. I chose to use 1\u2033 instead. you need .423\u2033 (that is the printed part and nut thickness) plus the thickness of your frame / bed material, minimum. Longer should not be an issue. Bed bearings \u00b6 Trying out a new style here, one side is shorter to allow for clamping if necessary. I found it usually is not, If you over tighten it you can actually crush the bearings and damage them. Default to super loose or no clamp screw/nut at all. Just a screw on the flush side should be enough. EndStops \u00b6 The endstops should be wired Normally Closed, NC, for safety. Initial leveling \u00b6 Rough When setting up your printer first level your X axis. Measure from the top of the motor mounts to the bottom of the vertical bearing blocks. The next thing is to level the bed. This is done by setting the 2 screws on the right side (front and back) to the nozzle height, then set the single screw on the left of the bed. Home Set each of the three endstop trigger screws such that the nozzle comes to rest just touching the print surface in the nearest left corner. Final and tune up Heat up the system, make sure the X axis is still level with the motor mounts, make sure the bed is still level with the nozzle. Adjust Z home trigger screw to get the correct first layer. Firmware \u00b6 The beta Marlin 2.0 version is on the GitHub page , or the old MP3DP firmware works (found below as a backup). There are nots on the GitHub version there are two settings that need to be changed for the MK8 or the Titan Aero, the thermistor value 11 for the MK8 or 5 for the Aero, and 100 steps for the E on the MK8. Slicer and MK8 \u00b6 If you need some initial settings to get started there are slicer settings at the end of this page , and a breakdown of an MK8 assembly.","title":"Second Version"},{"location":"mp3dp/version2/#mp3dp-v2-","text":"This is my take on a Prusa I3, with a CNC mill friendly frame.

The measurement is for the Outside Diameter of the conduit/rails/tubing. Please measure your rails before printing! 23.5mm fits \u00be\u2033 EMT conduit in the US. Anywhere else you must physically measure first. Some things are sold as Inside Dimension (ID) (conduit), or Outside Dimension (OD) (tubing). Hardware store steel EMT conduit works well and is inexpensive; an upgrade would be .065\u201d (max is 0.120\u201d) wall thickness stainless steel tubing or DOM. Stainless steel tubing is more rigid and smooth, but also much more expensive, Dom is less expensive than Stainless but requires some coating to prevent rust. Recommendations \u00b6 Recommended Print Settings: PLA for dimensional accuracy (PETG is also acceptable, if your dimensions are verified good and you are willing to sacrifice some rigidity). Two or more perimeters for through hole strength. There are some steep walls so no more than 75% layer height to nozzle diameter. No support should be needed for any part I have designed. Note If your 3D printer is of questionable quality it is best to run a quick basic frame test to make sure the parts will print as intended. If the test indicates that your frame is not square, then carefully check the frame and adjust, and retest. If you have to square the frame, then you might also consider printing the Advanced frame test .

You will need to drill 4 holes for M5 screws. It is best to oversize the holes (up to about 8mm is fine) to allow for some adjustment and non-perfect drilling. Note These are blind holes, do not drill through both sides of the tube Mark the rails according to the previous diagram. A center punch, center drill, or even filing a small flat spot helps with drilling accuracy. Tip You can draw a straight line on one rail using the other as a guide and/or a square block roughly half as high as the rail. Deburring the edges of the holes ensures good tool mount alignment. Leadscrew \u00b6 This step requires a stepper, 5mm to 8mm coupler, and your leadscrew. Note The cut calculator gives you a minimum screw length. The maximum screw length is the end of the Z rails when your axis is fully assembled. Loctite is a good idea for the small grub screws. Tighten the grub screw on the flat spot of the stepper shaft first. This is how these couplers should be used. The coupler should not be compressed; if anything, a little stretch to make sure the lead screw is in contact with the stepper shaft - this prevents bouncing. The lead screw should only be inserted as far as the coupler bottom collar. This lets the stepper shaft and leadscrew move for any minor misalignment. Seat the grub screws on the shaft trying to get the straightest connection possible. If you hit an edge of a thread it will get wonky; just give it a little turn and try again. On the stepper shaft, tighten the flat screw first then the one that hits the round surface. Stepper \u00b6 This step uses 4 M3x10mm screws, the printed Z Motor part, and the previous leadscrew assembly. Snug down all 4 screws. These stepper screws are easy to cross thread, take it slow and do not force anything. Thrust Block \u00b6 All you need is a bearing and the printed Z Coupler part for this step. Seat the bearing - the top should be flush with the part. Z Axis \u00b6 You will need all of the previous assemblies from this step. Pay attention to the direction the Z Coupler part is facing. Face the bearing towards the coupler. They will end up touching. Slide both rails in. The holes you drilled angle in and are on the same end. Info The lower Z Coupler part stays just above the middle holes to help with alignment. Don\u2019t push it all together yet. The stepper assembly should be flush with the top of the Z rails. Note The leadscrew can be a tight fit through the bearing. If this is the case, you can sand the top 30mm or so of the leadscrew and put the bearing on before the coupler. Nut Traps \u00b6 You will need the printed Nut Trap parts, and four M5 nuts. Pay attention to the direction the nylocks are facing. If you haven\u2019t already, it\u2019s highly recommended to pre-thread the nuts here. Seat the nuts in fully. A drop of glue is a good idea here. These are blind nuts and that prevents them from getting pushed out. Slide the Nut Traps into the rails. Pointy end first. The bottoms of the Nut Traps should be flush with the bottoms of the Z rails and the holes aligned. Tool Mount \u00b6 For this step you will need your tool mount of choice, 2-4 M5 screws depending on the mount, and both Upper and Lower printed Tool Plates. This is showing the Dewalt 660 mount . Using the embossed part letter as your guide position the plates. For this mount it is easy to start the screws and then loosely fit both tool mount pieces and get the screw well into the nuts. Once all four screws are started you can tighten them all a little at a time to keep the rails aligned. Snug these up all the way. You can now slide the Z Coupler part up to the coupler. The bearing should make contact with the coupler; it prevents the coupler stretching. Snug up the stepper assembly to the Z rails. Warning These are clamping parts so there will be a gap even when the part is tight. Very little force is needed here; 4 screws have a lot of holding power and they are only holding a few pounds. Push the bearing plate up to the coupler and make sure they are touching. The plates should be parallel and have equal spacing on both sides. Snug up the plate. Warning You can get the plate too tight and make the leadscrew hard to rotate. Once you have finished this step, make sure the coupler moves easily with your fingers. Z Core \u00b6 For this step you will need 4 nuts, bolts, bearings, and all four Core Z Clamp printed parts. The Core Z Clamps have an angled edge that should match the angled edge on the Core itself. Warning These bolts need to be extremely loose, only turn to just get the nylocks engaged. Insert the Z axis and get the leadscrew started to hold it in place. Very carefully start to tighten each clamp. You want each bearing to be in contact with the rail, but you should just be able to rotate the bearing with your fingers. 1/16 th of a turn here can be drastic. Take your time. You want each bearing to be in equal tension. This flexes the Core properly and keeps the Z axis perpendicular to the work surface. Over tightening is detrimental. Again, loose is better than tight. Move the axis up and down and check for free movement through the entire range. Tip You can give the Clamps a little tap to make sure they are seated correctly once they have some tension on them. Recheck the tension in the bearings. Note If your leadscrew starts to bind at the very bottom this is when you can move the brass nut screws around a bit to make sure this has smooth easy movements. Lubricate the Leadscrew \u00b6 The leadscrew needs lubrication .

Pay attention to the direction the nylocks are facing. If you haven\u2019t already, it\u2019s highly recommended to pre-thread the nuts here. Seat the nuts in fully. A drop of glue is a good idea here. These are blind nuts and that prevents them from getting pushed out. Slide the Nut Traps into the rails. Pointy end first. The bottoms of the Nut Traps should be flush with the bottoms of the Z rails and the holes aligned.","title":"Nut Traps"},{"location":"mpcnc/PZPage/#tool-mount","text":"For this step you will need your tool mount of choice, 2-4 M5 screws depending on the mount, and both Upper and Lower printed Tool Plates. This is showing the Dewalt 660 mount . Using the embossed part letter as your guide position the plates. For this mount it is easy to start the screws and then loosely fit both tool mount pieces and get the screw well into the nuts. Once all four screws are started you can tighten them all a little at a time to keep the rails aligned. Snug these up all the way. You can now slide the Z Coupler part up to the coupler. The bearing should make contact with the coupler; it prevents the coupler stretching. Snug up the stepper assembly to the Z rails. Warning These are clamping parts so there will be a gap even when the part is tight. Very little force is needed here; 4 screws have a lot of holding power and they are only holding a few pounds. Push the bearing plate up to the coupler and make sure they are touching. The plates should be parallel and have equal spacing on both sides. Snug up the plate. Warning You can get the plate too tight and make the leadscrew hard to rotate. Once you have finished this step, make sure the coupler moves easily with your fingers.","title":"Tool Mount"},{"location":"mpcnc/PZPage/#z-core","text":"For this step you will need 4 nuts, bolts, bearings, and all four Core Z Clamp printed parts. The Core Z Clamps have an angled edge that should match the angled edge on the Core itself. Warning These bolts need to be extremely loose, only turn to just get the nylocks engaged. Insert the Z axis and get the leadscrew started to hold it in place. Very carefully start to tighten each clamp. You want each bearing to be in contact with the rail, but you should just be able to rotate the bearing with your fingers. 1/16 th of a turn here can be drastic. Take your time. You want each bearing to be in equal tension. This flexes the Core properly and keeps the Z axis perpendicular to the work surface. Over tightening is detrimental. Again, loose is better than tight. Move the axis up and down and check for free movement through the entire range. Tip You can give the Clamps a little tap to make sure they are seated correctly once they have some tension on them. Recheck the tension in the bearings. Note If your leadscrew starts to bind at the very bottom this is when you can move the brass nut screws around a bit to make sure this has smooth easy movements.","title":"Z Core"},{"location":"mpcnc/PZPage/#lubricate-the-leadscrew","text":"The leadscrew needs lubrication .

Legs \u00b6 The leg lengths come from the cut calculator . Do whatever it takes to get the legs as equal in length as possible. This will really help in leveling and keeping it level. In this picture, the one on the far left is too short, so it could either be shimmed during assembly or sand/grind the other legs. A little extra time here pays off for the life of the machine. Tip Sand, grind, or file the inside and outside edges of all the cuts on the rails and legs. This prevents cut wires and eases assembly. Tools \u00b6 8mm Socket or nut driver Phillips #2 Screwdriver Legs and Feet \u00b6 You will need the legs, printed feet, M5x30 screws and locknuts. Tip It is best to pre-thread all the locknuts before assembly. This will loosen them and prevent mangling of the printed parts. Insert the leg and make sure it is seated all the way to the table. The feet have a small side for the head of the screw and a larger opening for the nut and socket. Snug this screw. Snug means just a \u00bc turn past the nut making contact. This does not need to be super tight. There is a 2+mm gap here, do not try to close the gap . Base Layout \u00b6 Use whatever screws are appropriate for your table, these are not included in the V1 Kits. Layout the foot assemblies on your table according to the dimensions from the cut calculator . Notice all the clamping screws are oriented towards the center of the build area. Screw down the two assemblies along the front edge of the table. These will be your fixed references. Measure as carefully and accurately as you can across the leg tops. Your machine can only be as accurate as you build it. Validate that the front length exactly matches the back length, and that the left and right lengths match. Measure diagonally across the leg tops. Compare this measurement to the next one. This next diagonal should match the previous one. Squaring this way can be extremely accurate because any error in the leg locations is multiplied in this measurement. Adjust both rear legs until you are satisfied with the precision. Screw in one foot at a time, minor adjustments are possible. Triple check the diagonals - they need to be as close as you can get them. Tip Marking and pre-drilling the foot hold downs in the center of the screw slots makes it much easier to get a square base. It allows a tiny bit of room for adjustment. Leg Locks \u00b6 You will need the printed Corner Leg Locks and M5 locknuts. It is best to pre-thread all the locknuts before assembly. This will loosen them and prevent mangling of the printed parts. Push the nut into the Corner Leg Lock and fully seat it. If it does not stay on its own you can use a drop of glue. If the nut does not stay on its own, you can attach the Corner Bottom very loosely with its bolt. Fully seat the Corner Leg Locks onto the legs. Orient to match the Feet below. Do not lock/clamp them. Corner Bottoms \u00b6 You will need the printed Corner Bottoms and Corner Bottom Mirrored and M5x30 screws. Warning If you are not using the V1 Kit, please make sure your screw heads are low profile enough not to interfere with the Lower Rail. The Corner Bottoms go on the Leg Locks as shown. Pay attention to how the belt slider slots are oriented. They point towards each other on the outside of the build area. This picture is taken with the 0,0 (home) corner in the bottom nearest left. The corners should be as shown. Get the screws started to hold the Leg Locks and Corner Bottoms together. Leave them loose, just tight enough to make the screw head clear the rail. Temporarily adding the Y rails will align the corners. Lock The Legs \u00b6 You will need four sets of the M5 screws and locknuts. It is best to pre-thread all the locknuts before assembly. This will loosen them and prevent mangling of the printed parts. Snug up all four Leg Locks. Snug is just that, \u00bc turn past the screw and nut seating into the part. Just tight enough to make the corner have some resistance if you try to take it off the leg. All clamping parts have a gap. Do not clamp it hard enough to close the gap ! Now remove the rails and snug up the screw in the bottom of the corner pieces. Tip This screw is tightened after the Leg Locks so the Corner Bottom will correctly and fully seat on the angled joint between the two parts. If you tighten the bottom first, you might have a hard time locking the leg into place or the Corner Bottom could come loose. Leveling \u00b6 Put the Y rails back in place. Use whatever means you have at your disposal to assure all four corners are at the same level. If you were careful with your leg lengths this should be level already. Loosening the screws and giving the corners a light tap can seat them a tiny bit farther if needed. Final Check. \u00b6 Best practice is to check your work at every step. Measure the diagonal measurement to the best of your abilities. This diagonal should match. You should aim for no more than 1 mm deviation. If there is an issue, loosen the screws into the table and nudge a leg assembly.

The Core is very dependent on the order of assembly. You will need 4 bolts, nuts, bearings, and the Core printed part Snap the bearings into the slots. You can line them up and give them a tap with the ratchet handle and they should pop into place. This is intentional to add rigidity. Hint If you pop the bearings in too far or need to get them out, the rear has a hole for an Allen key to push them back out. Paying attention to the direction of the bolt heads, insert the bolts and nuts. Snug these bolts up, just 1/16 th of a turn past seated (touching the plastic on both sides). Caution Ratchets are dangerous here. We only need 7in/lbs or so. It is next to nothing. Loose is better than too tight. That is true for all of these steps. Inner Z Bearings \u00b6 4 more bolts, nuts, and bearings Attach all 4 bearings, paying attention to the direction of the bolt heads (for Z clearance). Snug these up, 7in/lbs, just past seated. Core Clamps \u00b6 For each Core Clamp printed part you will also need 2 bolts, 2 nuts, and 2 bearings. The bolt head direction and the part orientation are easy to miss. Pay attention to the pictures to make sure you don\u2019t have clearance issues later. This first one is the Core Clamp Y . The flat side faces towards the logo and needs to be in this location. The Core ClampY is specifically made to clear a bolt head on the Truck. Two bearings are at an angle between the Core and Core Clamp. Insert the top bearing and bolt first, then the bottom. Note Don\u2019t miss these two bearings. Add All 4 sets. Snug up all these bolts, 7in/lbs, just past seated. Do not crush the 1 mm spacers. Double-check the part orientation. Flat sides of the Core Clamps face away from each other. Notice where the Core ClampY part is located. Tip The holes in the Core Clamps are just for you to mount things if you need a spot. The holes fit M5s (or cable ties). Gantry Rail Tension Bolts \u00b6 4 bolts and bearings Slide a bearing in the Core Clamps. The bolt heads should all be up - let gravity keep them in place. Do not use a nut yet. All 4 bolt heads up, no nuts yet. Setting the Gantry Rails \u00b6 You will need a rail and nuts for each tension bolt. Slide the rail in the assembly. The rail should have slight tension and feel good with no nuts in place. All the bearings should be making contact. If your rail is loose or too tight there could be other issues. At this point, put the nuts on. Carefully seat the nuts just to lock in the current tension. A very light touch is needed here. You will be coming back to these so just seat the bolts and nuts. The rails should have a slight drag and feel the same with and without the nuts in place. Tip More tension is not better. Too loose and too tight are bad. If your rails did not have a good feeling tension like the Trucks in the earlier steps please stop and ask in the forums for help. If the rails feel really tight before adding the tension nuts with the rail in place loosen and tighten the two other nuts and bolts in each Core Clamp. This can give extra room if needed. Truck Locks \u00b6 Add both gantry rails. The open face of the Core should face the 0,0 corner (left nearest corner). Info Because of the asymmetry of the Trucks, if the Core doesn\u2019t point to 0,0, the work area will be smaller. Snug up the Truck Clamps. There is a gap here, same as the clamping parts. Do not try to close the gap. No need to stop the rails from rotating but there should be resistance. Leadscrew Nut \u00b6 You will need the brass T8 lead screw nut and two M3x10 screws. The nut has, and needs, some wiggle room. Seat two of the screws and then back them off about \u00bd turn. You should just be able to move the nut forward and backwards but not up and down. Tip This has to move to help with the Z screw alignment. Too tight and you can get binding. Another tip is to screw them in as shown in the picture, then move the nut back (away from them). If you find you are getting some binding, try moving the screws to the back instead.

I would like to drive that price home one more time. You can have a CNC router for precision work ( here , here all the way up to aluminum milling and plasma cutting steel for under $600. That is all you need to spend, throw in a few endmills and you are still under $620. There is no other machine more versatile than the Mostly Printed CNC at any price point. Specs\u2026 \u00b6 Not easy to make a specs page when it can have almost any specs you want. The idea behind this is to be extremely adaptable and inexpensive. Why buy a single use machine when you can have one that does it all for less than the cost of any single function machine. No proprietary hardware or software, build it any size and shape you want (more on this later), buy it from this site or source it all yourself, helpful forums, low cost, and capable. What more could you ask for? This machine can easily do many things, how about making some coffee with Apach\u2026(not me but I think he is my new hero). Size \u00b6 All axes can be any length you prefer, anything over 3 \u00bd\u2032 (1M) would require small mid-span supports to increase rigidity, of course smaller is better. The kit comes with enough belt for up to 48\u2033 of total outer X and Y axis dimensions (eg 24\u2033x24\u2033, 36\u2033x12\u2033 or any other combination). The smaller you make this the faster you can move it and the more rigid/accurate it will be, and more importantly the easier it will be to get the desired accuracy. The linear motion is ball bearings on electrical conduit (or stainless steel)\u2026 seriously, easy to use and source. More information on this here . If this machine isn\u2019t big enough I have also designed the LowRider CNC , all the same specs and resolution just designed to be bigger! Power \u00b6 X and Y axis are powered by 2 stepper motors each, and a single stepper for the Z axis. The standard would be NEMA 17 in any torque preferably 42 OZ/in and above (the kit comes with 76 OZ/in). No need for NEMA 23\u2019s or their required larger drivers, torque is not one of this machines issues. Belts are used for their accuracy and price. Small belts are used because each axis has two of them. Ball screws are expensive, require tuning, and periodic maintenance / adjustments. Control \u00b6 This is all controlled by any control board you like. The UltiMachine boards are recommended for the improved design and robust safety features. You can still use the common Ramps 1.4 or any other boards as well. There are other Marlin based boards, GRBL , and regular CNC boards as well. Software \u00b6 There are plenty of free or really inexpensive software options available for 3D printing, CAM, and CAD. I suggest Fusion 360 , Repetier-host , ESTLCam , etc. DIY \u00b6 Besides using either common imperial or metric hardware, the rest of the machine is easily 3D printable, RepRap style!

The squarer your build, the more accurate your cuts. Previously you squared your base, then the Trucks to the base, and now you are squaring the Core. If you use dual endstop firmware you will be able to dial this in even further. Machine accuracy is much easier to achieve with the Primo version. Test \u00b6 An easy test is to measure and compare the Trucks as they sit. You should have no belts attached at this point. Move the gantry around by hand and place it roughly in the center of your work area. Measure each Truck pair without moving the gantry in the process. Measure the other Truck. Test both pairs of Trucks. Move the gantry around and test all four again. The numbers should be very close to the first test. Adjust \u00b6 Start with whichever gantry rail has the most error. Tightening a Core Clamp will move the rail and Truck away from that bolt. The outer Core Clamps have the largest effect. Use small adjustments. 1/16 th of a turn at a time. After each adjustment move the gantry around and test the Truck pair distances again. Repeat this a few times. Tip This should be very small adjustments and you are looking to get them within 1mm. If you over tighten them they stop moving. So, if the Trucks are showing no effect, loosen the tension bolts all the way and start again. The minimum tension was set in the Core building step, so you will begin by tightening the clamps. At some point you can also loosen them a bit for the opposite effect.

Bearings \u00b6 You will need 5 sets of 5/16 x 1 \u00bd\u201d (M8 x 40mm) bolts and locknuts. Two \u00bd\u201d sockets and ratchets (or 13mm for M8\u2019s). 5 bearings. Printed Truck and Truck Mirrored parts. Tension Bolts \u00b6 Insert the bearings in the Truck and fit the bolts. Just seat the locknuts, they will get adjusted later. Leave them loose. Note Pay attention to the direction of the bolt heads on these two tension bolts. Stationary Bearings \u00b6 Fit the last 3 bearings and bolt sets. Notice the bolt orientation, nuts towards the rails. Snug these up. About 7in/lbs. Caution Using ratchets makes over tightening the bolts very easy. There are small 1mm built in spacers in the printed parts, if you crush these you are about 3x too tight. Loose is better than tight. If you work on your own car it is wayyyyyy less that any bolt you have ever tightened. Set The Truck Tension \u00b6 Insert a rail into the Truck. You are looking for all bearings to make contact and just a hint of tension. If you tip the rail at a 45 degree angle the Trucks should slowly move. Too tight and they will stay, too loose and they will drop right off. Tension both bolts evenly - for a new print this should actually just be good with no extra tension needed. If this is the case, just snug up the tension bolts until the heads and nuts are touching the plastic. Holding not adding to the current tension. Caution If you have to really torque down on these bolts you could have the wrong sized rails or parts. The same thing applies if they are too tight, although you can let them sit overnight with no tension on the bolts to see if they loosen up a bit. Truck Clamp \u00b6 You will need the printed Truck Clamps. M5 x 30mm screw and locknut. #2 screwdriver. Leave these loose, just engaging the nylocks. The rail will be added later. Tip For all the screws with captured nuts it is best to pre-thread them to loosen them up a bit to prevent ruining the printed parts. Belts and Idlers \u00b6 You will need two idlers for each Truck. Two M5 screws and nuts. #2 screwdriver. Tip If you add the belts first it is easier than trying to fish them through later. Each axis has a mirrored set of Trucks, so that is an easy way to also pair up the belts. Tuck in the idlers into the pocket in the Trucks. Tighten the screws just tight enough to seat the nut all the way then back off a \u00bd turn. Ensure the idlers are free spinning. Pulleys \u00b6 Steppers Pulleys Wire Darryl / pulley spacer (optional) Loctite You can use the Wire Darryl to set the pulley height or just do it by eye in the next step.

The Bundle has all the hardware and electronics except the conduit/rails which are cheaper to source locally than to ship \u2013 $271 + shipping if international. 20\u2032 of Conduit \u2248$12 (or stainless-steel tubing for a little more \u2248$43) . Plastic parts, filament, less than 2 spools \u2248$30 if you own a 3D printer, if not buy it from here for $135. Tool. Either a Dewalt , import spindle or an extruder (3D Printer) $53, or anything else you might want to bolt on, laser, drag knife , foam cutting needle (awesome), etc. Total Cost\u2026 if you have a 3D printer Under $370 , $475 if you buy the printed parts from here. I would like to drive that price home one more time, you can have a CNC router for precision work ( here , here all the way up to aluminum milling and plasma cutting steel for $486. That is all you need to spend, throw in a few endmills and you are still under $500. There is no other machine more versatile than the Mostly Printed CNC at any price point. Specs\u2026 \u00b6 Not easy to make a specs page when it can have most any specs you want. The idea behind this is to be extremely adaptable and inexpensive. Why buy a single use machine when you can have one that does it all for less than the cost of any single function machine. No proprietary hardware or software, build it any size and shape you want (more on this later), buy it from this site or source it all yourself, helpful forums, low cost, and capable. What more could you ask for? This machine can easily do many things, how about making some coffee with Apach\u2026(not me but I think he is my new hero). Size \u00b6 All axis can be any length you prefer, anything over 3 \u00bd\u2032 (1M) would require small mid-span supports to increase rigidity, of course smaller is better. The kit comes with enough belt for up to 48\u2033 of total outer X and Y axis dimensions (eg 24\u2033x24\u2033, 36\u2033x12\u2033 or any other combination). The smaller you make this the faster you can move it and the more rigid/accurate it will be, and more importantly the easier it will be to get the desired accuracy. The linear motion is ball bearings on electrical conduit (or stainless steel)\u2026 seriously, easy to use and source. More information on this here . If this machine isn\u2019t big enough, I have also designed the LowRider CNC , all the same specs and resolution just designed to be bigger! Power \u00b6 X and Y axis are powered by 2 stepper motors each, and a single stepper for the Z axis. The standard would be NEMA 17 in any torque preferably 42 OZ/in and above (the kit come with 76 OZ/in). No need for NEMA 23\u2019s or their required larger drivers, torque is not one of this machines issues. Belts are used for their accuracy and price. Small belts are used because each axis has two of them. Ball screws are expensive, require tuning, and periodic maintenance / adjustments. Control \u00b6 This is all controlled by any control board you like. The UltiMachine boards are recommended for the improved design and robust safety features. You can still use the common Ramps 1.4 or any other boards as well. There are other Marlin based boards, GRBL , and regular CNC boards as well. Software \u00b6 There are plenty of free or really inexpensive software options available for 3D printing, CAM, and CAD. I suggest Fusion 360 , Repetier-host , ESTLCam , etc. DIY \u00b6 Besides using either common imperial or metric hardware, the rest of the machine is easily 3D printable, RepRap style!

Roller Assembly - Fixed Bearings \u00b6 Use the 1.25\u2033 (M8 X 30) bolts, lock nuts, 608 bearings, and the Roller or RollerM. Nuts are best facing towards each other, unless you plan on adding mid span supports then the other way could get you some extra clearance. These can get snugged up, don\u2019t crack the plastic , just snug. Do this for all 4 sets. Roller Assembly - Tension Bolts \u00b6 2.5\u2033 (M8 X 65) bolt, 608 Bearings, Roller or Dual plates. Use the 2.5\u2033 (M8 X 65) bolt, run it through the Roller Plate (or the dual plates ). After the Roller plate add a 608 bearing. Add the plate and bearing stack into the Roller from the single bearing side. Only part way Add a Bearing into the center of the roller, and thread the bolt the rest of the way into the roller. Pay attention to the direction of the plate, the stand offs should face the bearings , and the extra notches should face the single bearing. Rollers on Rails \u00b6 Previous assemblies, 5/16\u201d (M8) Nylock nuts, X or Y rail. The nut for the 2.5\u2033 (M8 X 65) bolt should be left extremely loose almost touching the roller but not all the way. Make sure these nuts don\u2019t interfere with the small nut slots, if they do put the small nuts in now. Put all the rollers on their rails and make sure they all slide equally well. There should be tension when inserting the rail and all the bearings should touch. Roller Matched Pairs \u00b6 This is showing the pairs for the X and Y axis. It should be one Roller and one RollerM. It does not matter which way the gantry rail angle is facing as long as it is facing the same as its counterpart. Roller and RollerM are just a mirrored set, made to help with printer deficiencies. Each axis gets one of each and the need to look mirrored (angle on the same side). When using the optional Dual plates, the long side should face X0 Y0 (nearest left corner) Lower Corner Assembly \u00b6 Previous assemblies, Spacer_corners Add your Y rails and rollers to the corner assemblies (front to back axes). Make sure the angled belt brackets face out, and the angles are pointed towards each other. Lay a Spacer_Corner on the rail. Lay the X rail and rollers on next (Right to left axes). Full Corner Assembly \u00b6 Top_Corner pieces, \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20) screws, and nuts. Put on the Top_Corner pieces. Make sure the brackets are facing out, and the angles towards each other.

If instead you tightened both A bolts a bit the angle should open up. If you run into Z axis perpendicularity issues later on it usually means your C tension bolts are not equal.

If you run into Z axis perpendicularity issues later on it usually means your C tension bolts are not equal. Tighter on top pushes the rails away from the bolt, as well as the bottoms. A square from the work surface to the Z rails can test this after full assembly.","title":"TIPS"},{"location":"mpcnc/burly/middle-assm/#done-looks-cool-right","text":"Main assembly page","title":"Done, looks cool right?!"},{"location":"mpcnc/burly/parts/","text":"MPCNC Parts \u00b6 Printed Parts \u00b6 There are 3 different sets of printed parts C -23.5mm, F -25mm, or J -25.4mm (1 inch).

You will see lots of images of people attaching cable chains, wires, and vacuum hoses to the motor mount. This is the absolute worst place on the entire machine to attach anything! It will act as a torque multiplier and completely ruin your accuracy/precision. Anything necessary should be attached to the main gantry assembly there is lots of room on the XYZ piece. The tool mount piece uses either #6 lock nuts or M4. Insert the nuts facing the right direction and if they are not a snug fit a tiny drop of glue in the corner will keep them from falling out. I add one after they are inserted right at the corner of each nut just to be safe. I use cyanoacrylate gel. It is not doing anything other making sure they do not fall out when not in use, if they are in use they do not depend on the glue at all. Insert the 4 nuts into the nut traps, if they aren\u2019t a tight fit a drop of glue here will help in assembly later. Insert the nut traps into your cut and drilled Z rails, pointed end up. Align the holes. Get all four screws \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20) started but leave them extremely loose for a later alignment step. Press the bearing into the Z-Lower bracket. Make sure it is seated all the way and not crooked. Tighten the coupler onto the shaft, first tighten grub screw on the stepper shaft flat spot, then the grub screw on the round part. Make sure the shaft is most of the way into the coupler as shown in the cutaway. Use 3 M3x10mm screws to attach the stepper to the Z-Motor bracket. Do not insert the Lead Screw yet. The picture is to show you how far the shaft should be set. Use no screws on the Z mounts yet. Slide the Z-lower bracket onto the z rails open bearing side will face away from the tool mount. Slide it all the way to just above the tool mount. Next add the motor mount. This step lets you align the rails and snug up the tool mount 4 screws \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20). Snug, if you hear a crack you went overboard. Slide the lower tool mount to where it just touches the coupler but does not compress it at all. IMPORTANT STEP Make sure the coupler touches the bearing so it can support the weight of the tool. We are using the ball bearing as a thrust bearing (not the right type of bearing but it is a tiny load). At this point hang the assembly off the edge of a table. Make sure the rails are sitting flat on the table, if it is not loosening, push down on the rails, and tighten the tool mount screws. If the rails are twisted it will rock back and forth\u2026that is bad. Try to get the gap between mounts to be relatively equal while still touching the coupler and bearing. This dimension will be different for every build. Check again, are the rails still flat? Add the screws \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20) and nuts to the Z brackets, snug slightly. Snug slightly means, less than you think . If it is too loose at some point the mounts could move up and is very easily noticed and is easily fixed by going a very tiny bit snugger. If they are too tight you will crack the mount, not easily fixed. Err on the side of too loose. Check again, are the rails still sitting flat? Add the lead screw into the coupler. The lead screw should touch the motor shaft to fight thrust in the other direction from the lower mount bearing. Again, not the best engineering solution but it works great with this light load. The lead screw should be at least as long as the calculator specifies, but no longer than the bottom of the Z rails. If you are having a hard time getting the lead screw through the bearing, lightly sand or file the top 25mm (1\u2033) or so of the lead screw. It can be a tight fit. Lube the lead screw.

You might need its included drivers, so it is best to let them install. MAC User? -IT should work as is but here is some info if you find you are having issues you might need to change the firmware baud rate and perhaps a different driver. Firmware \u00b6 If you bought a system from me the firmware is pre-loaded, and you do not need to make any changes. Marlin is the firmware currently used and it is pre-flashed on the control board included in the kit ( download the pre-configured files here ). If you are building your own feel free to use any board/firmware you want. Testing \u00b6 Never plug or unplug anything into the control board while there is any power, USB or power plug! It is best to start with Repetier-Host It is an easy program to use (do not use repetier server), just in case here is a basic set up . Move your gantry to the center of your build space and make sure the z axis is roughly centered in its travel. You never know which way it\u2019s going to go! With all the motors plugged in, plug in the USB cable and the power to the control board and hit connect in the upper left corner of repetier, it should take a few seconds and turn green to indicate it is connected. Note If you are using a dual end stop firmware flashed board, you have to have the end stops properly connected first, Info . If you have a series flashed board no end stops are needed. You can now use the control in the manual tab to move the machine. The arrows allow for .1, 1, 10, 50mm movements. Start small 1 mm at a time. The arrows should move it in that direction. X positive (Right arrow) should move Right , X negative should move Left, Y positive (up arrow) is back or away from you , Y negative is towards you. Z positive (Z up arrow) moves the z axis up , meaning the tool away from the work surface. If it doesn\u2019t move as expected hit disconnect, unplug the power and USB, any axis that is moving the wrong way simply flip the plug . If one stepper is moving the wrong way power down and flip it\u2019s plug. Power back up and test again. Control Software \u00b6 Now that your machine can talk to your computer you need to be able to control it. You can either use an lcd screen or control software. For the beginners software is usually easier to learn than the LCD screen. This can move the machine along any of the three axis and can also send gcode generated in any program (estlcam, slic3r, Image2Gcode, Fusion360, etc.). Repetier-Host is an easy program to use, here is a basic set up . You can also use Pronterface, Matter Control, ESTLCAM, or many others. Again for the beginners, start with repetier-host (not server). CNC Step 1 \u2013 First Use \u00b6 Now the machine should be moving around and once you finally get bored of manually moving it around it is time to put it to work. Let\u2019s start with ESTLCAM I have put together a little walk through using Estlcam as a plotter. So strap on a pen , (or a \u201cspindle\u201d if you know what you\u2019re doing). The infamous Crown\u2026 Follow the Basic instructions on how to actually use the machine. Test code available at the bottom of that page. If you ask for help I will ask about your crown test. CNC Step 2 \u2013 Getting dirty \u00b6 Now the machine can draw pictures it is time to get it dirty.

X positive (Right arrow) should move Right , X negative should move Left, Y positive (up arrow) is back or away from you , Y negative is towards you. Z positive (Z up arrow) moves the z axis up , meaning the tool away from the work surface. If it doesn\u2019t move as expected hit disconnect, unplug the power and USB, any axis that is moving the wrong way simply flip the plug . If one stepper is moving the wrong way power down and flip it\u2019s plug. Power back up and test again.","title":"Testing"},{"location":"software/#control-software","text":"Now that your machine can talk to your computer you need to be able to control it.

F-Engrave Settings \u00b6 Here are some working F-Engrave settings: The first part that you are creating is the \u201cfemale\u201d part, this is pocket that will accept the inlay or \u201cmale\u201d part. To create the \u201cmale\u201d part you will need to mirror the image in F-Engrave, select Prismatic and Add Box on the V-carve settings. Then you will repeat the process of creating the gcode files for the \u201cmale\u201d part. This may look odd, but it will fit snugly into the \u201cfemale\u201d part. Post Processing with MODfef \u00b6 Start MODfef and process the output files from F-engrave \u00b6 Select the MAIN file, the \u201cVCLEAN\u201d file and the \u201cCLEAN\u201d file You can also select a custom start file and end file (these are not produced by F-engrave) You can select the file extension for your gcode file You can enter a tool change line. The program will insert a pause here so you can change your cutter on the machine. You can enter the character that should be used for comments. F-engrave will enclose comments in parentheses () by default. You can choose if you want the files to be concatenated. If you select this it will make one file with a tool change. The output file will have the same name as the \u201cMAIN\u201d file but with your new extension. The concatenated file will contain the \u201cSTART\u201d file (if one is selected), then the \u201cMAIN\u201d file, then the \u201cVCLEAN\u201d file (if one is selected), then the tool change, then the \u201cCLEAN\u201d file (if one is selected), then the \u201cEND\u201d file (if one is selected). Carving \u00b6 Load the MODfef processed gcode file into Octoprint (or your gcode streamer) Select appropriate wood for the inlay Choose contrasting wood for the male and female parts The male part is wood that will be inlayed. The female part is the wood that will have the inlay glued into it. Set up the work piece for the female part, remember that your origin is set to the middle of the inlay. Set up the V cutter first. Cut the female part. If you have clean up files you will need to do a tool change, the system should just pause and allow you to complete that. Set up the flat end mill that you specified in F-Engrave and complete the \u201cfemale\u201d part. Once its complete, remove the \u201cfemale\u201d part and replace it with the \u201cmale\u201d (inlay) wood. Set up the V cutter again and set your origin over the center of the wood. Cut the male part. Once more if you have clean files you may have a tool change. It\u2019s the same process that you completed with the \u201cfemale\u201d part. Clean up and Assembly \u00b6 Once its complete clean up both parts. I use a scalpel to clean any edges or corners that need it. I also remove any burs that may be present. I dry fit them to see that the gap between the male and female parts are consistent. If it doesn\u2019t look right using some color on the inlay protrusions during a dry fit can help to show where the parts are interfering. Glue the parts together I use regular wood glue and leave it to dry overnight It is important to clamp the parts evenly as you can influence the fit which will spoil the inlay effect. Trim the excess from the inlay (male part) I usually do this on the band saw but you can do it with any tool that will remove the excess wood without dislodging the inlay. Sand the part down until the inlay is flush There is normally quite a bit of inlay wood to be removed, some form of belt sander works very well here. Finish the part with the appropriate finish It depends on the type of wood you have chosen. Select a finish that will work with both the female wood and the male wood.

You should have a firm grasp on the basics before trying this. This is how to manually set up a 2.5D cut, the alternative would be to import an STL file and let ESTLCAM choose the paths. The automatically generated STL paths took 50 minutes to cut and did not pick up the small 4mm hole. The following manual paths took 18 minutes to cut and look fantastic! So I can show some different techniques in this walk though I am using piece of Brazilian Ipe that has an uneven top surface, so no reliable Z origin. I will use the bed as the start position and tell ESTLCAM the work surface is slightly higher than measured on the thickest part of the wood. This will allow me to easily surface the uneven wood and not have to estimate where the origin should be. The tool paths start with importing the DXF file in mm. This file has all the part paths on it but not the depth of cut so we will work though this one step at a time. The tool will be starting off to the left of the actual piece of wood touching the bed so the first step is to move the zero point over about half an inch, to approximate where the tool will start. Just select Zero, Point, and Click where you want the new Zero. These are the dimensions I will be using for the depths of cut. The first cutting step will be the basic surfacing of the wood to make sure the top is nice and flush. I don\u2019t have much thickness to spare so for surfacing I am only cutting 1.55mm into the work surface. Because I am starting from the bed the Z origin will be set at the end when ESTLCAM asks for the part height, that will be the Z zero plane (I will be using 11.5mm). So for this part my Z=0 will be 11.5mm from the bed surface. If you had a nice flat piece of material you can make it easier and just start at the work surface. For the cut I select Inside, pocket , and selected the outermost path, shown in red. Make sure to set the tool path depth and machining order starting at one and increment by at least one. The next cut will be a pocket taking the whole surface down in 2 steps, a rough and finishing pass. For the roughing we can start at 1.55mm from the Z=0 plane since that material is already gone from the previous step and go into the material another 4.85mm as seen in the part dimensions. For the roughing pass we will leave an allowance of 0.2mm. This lets us come back round for a second pass and only have to mill of .2mm of wood and this leaves a nice smooth finished surface. So we use an inside pocket pass with .2mm allowance and then a second just inside cut with 0 allowance since the material has already been removed with the roughing pocket no need to cut all that empty space. Current tool path shown in red. Again, always set the machining order. This new pocket will be the depth at which we start the rest of the cuts (6.4mm) Next will be the 4mm hole. We can use a Helical path and start from 6.4mm deep and go a little into the spoil board, I went an extra .2mm for a cut of 5.3mm Now 3 more inside cuts, rough pockets followed by finishing passes. Now that the inner features have been finished it is time to cut the part from the material, leaving 3 small tabs that can easily be snipped off. For this step will be using an outside cut, with a .2mm allowance, setting the tabs, starting at the Z=0 plane since the outer edge did not get surfaced and cutting .2mm in to the waste board (11.7mm deep). Then the finishing pass with 0 allowance and matching the tabs previously set. Now save your project in case you need to come back and edit your paths. You can do this by using the select tool and changing the popup box parameters. Then export your CNC program (gcode). I use repetier as my visualizer to make sure the cuts look like they should, but to catch small errors if you are new to this I always suggest cutting into high density foam the first run to test your path. Better to waste some time and foam than stress your machine, break a bit, and waste material with some bad gcode. This leaves me with fairly finished part. I can pop it out and use a razor knife to cut off the tabs. I then hit the edges lightly with some 220 git sand paper and call it a day.

EstlCAM is for generating GCode. This software seems to do everything I want. It also seems to be translated into every language I\u2019ve ever heard of, if not you can add translations in the software. The installer is in German I think but the options are easy to understand. Please buy a copy if you find this works for you. Step one \u2013 Install Estlcam \u00b6 Install Estlcam. Using the default options in the installer, add Icon to start menu and desktop. The first window that pops up I set the language, change the display units, and set it to show the feed rate in mm/s on the tool popups. After you click okay close Estlcam and restart it to update the settings. Step 2 \u2013 Setup \u00b6 After restarting Estlcam, open the setup tab, these are the settings from the first window plus a few extra. Changing the clearance plane to something a little smaller really speeds up a job since the z axis is the slowest. This is how far above the material it should travel to before it moves. You should change the milling direction depending on what kind of material you are cutting, more on this in another post. Setting the z-axis origin to the top of the material makes it easy to set the home position, along with that is program start \u2013 at origin. Choosing to end the program \u201cabove origin\u201d is safe, \u201cabove last position\u201d is the fastest. The creator of Estlcam recently updated his software for us! In the CNC Program Generation tab, choose Marlin (if you are using my firmware). Important \u2013 Set feed unit to mm/min- (this is what the marlin firmware needs). Change the file extension \u201cgcode\u201d so all the programs recognize it. Next up is the travel feed rates. 2100/60=35mm/s, 480=8mm/s (keep the Z low) I delete all the default tools and use this as a conservative test speed setting for an \u215b\u2033 flat endmill in wood. Do not exceed 8mm/s in the z plunge field unless you know what you are doing and know what firmware limits you have. You are ready to generate some GCode. Step 3 \u2013 2D gcode, Good for pen plotting or 2D milling (cutting things out) \u00b6 Grid Size. DXF files are crazy sizes sometimes so to make sure your DXF is the right size change the grid. Found in View>Grid I set mine to 10mm or 25.4mm=1in. For this 2D or 2.5D work .DXF files are used. You can use any vector program to make them, illustrator, SolidWorks, etc. Get some files from here, (Need a new source, sorry). I used this one in the video , Crown Vector . Open DXF. File>Open \u2013 If your DXF is completely the wrong size try again with different initial units. This is what the crown looks like imported in inches as the initial units. This is whatever units you save your DXF as. Step 4 \u2013 Scale / Re-Zero \u00b6 The crown imported at about 55mm wide I want about 150mm wide. Select>Resize>Drawing Layers , then click on the DXF to select it. I scaled the crown 250x to get it to 150mm (5 \u00be\u2033). Zoom out to see your DXF. Zero>Create arbitrary point , then select outside of the DXF paths. This is how to set your origin (or Home). The little blue plus symbol is what your machine sees as 0,0 (x=0, y=0, generally the lower left corner of your work). When you start your program the machine will work to the right and above where you start it from (represented by the blue plus). Some people like to work from the center for round or oval objects. Step 5 \u2013 Select the tool paths \u00b6 To use the pen you want to draw on the line so use engrave (tool centered on line), if you were cutting a part you can choose part (tool edge on the outside of line), or cutout (tool edge in inside of line). Click Engrave then just click on each line segment. Step 6 \u2013 Save \u00b6 Export. File>Save CNC Program . Give it a name. You will get a depth popup, for the pen I use 1mm or less, anything else, set it to the thickness of your material plus a bit to cut all the way through. You can then preview the path. Step 7 \u2013 Control Software \u00b6 Open repetier-host . load the .gcode (or .nc , .ngc) file you just saved. If you have the bed size adjusted you can get a sense of scale. If you can\u2019t see the lines check the box Print Preview>Show Travel moves. View it from the edge and you can see that the path is below your z-home, and the movements are above z-home. Don\u2019t pay any attention as to where it is shown on the bed. It will start where ever your head currently is. Step 8 \u00b6 Start. Put the tip of the pen (or tool) a hair above where you want it to start and hit run. It should pick up, move, drop down and go. If it goes down first and doesn\u2019t pick up between moves your z axis is backwards. Flip the plug . Test File \u00b6 Test Crown 12mm/s GCODE \u2013 Test Crown 12mm/s Zipped file . Final \u00b6 This all it takes to plot with a pen or do basic 2D (2.5D) milling, some of the most common things this type of mill is used for. Make sure to adjust your tool and its settings depending on the material in use. Always do a test cut! Here is an old video, the new Burly pen holder or Primo pen / knife holder has built in spring so you will get even more consistent results.","title":"EstlCAM Setup"},{"location":"software/estlcam-basics/#estlcam-basics","text":"Estlcam is found here.

Choosing to end the program \u201cabove origin\u201d is safe, \u201cabove last position\u201d is the fastest. The creator of Estlcam recently updated his software for us! In the CNC Program Generation tab, choose Marlin (if you are using my firmware). Important \u2013 Set feed unit to mm/min- (this is what the marlin firmware needs). Change the file extension \u201cgcode\u201d so all the programs recognize it. Next up is the travel feed rates. 2100/60=35mm/s, 480=8mm/s (keep the Z low) I delete all the default tools and use this as a conservative test speed setting for an \u215b\u2033 flat endmill in wood. Do not exceed 8mm/s in the z plunge field unless you know what you are doing and know what firmware limits you have. You are ready to generate some GCode.","title":"Step 2 \u2013 Setup"},{"location":"software/estlcam-basics/#step-3-2d-gcode-good-for-pen-plotting-or-2d-milling-cutting-things-out","text":"Grid Size.

Then use the screw on the end to adjust it so it sticks out the approximate thickness of your material. It isn\u2019t much, more than paper, less than a credit card. Warning Do not touch the end that little knife will slice you very quickly. The button on the end is to push the blade out for removal. Set the Depth Of Cut \u00b6 Try and hold the cutter as perpendicular to the work material as possible and draw a circle on a hard flat smooth surface, glass or similar. If you go through the paper like the second photo you are much too deep, adjust the blade and locking ring again. Keep adjusting and drawing circles to get the depth right. The third picture looks close, but if you look at the paper backing in the 4 th picture it is still a bit too deep. Ideal Depth \u00b6 What you are looking for is all the way through the material and a slight dent in the paper backing, but not a cut.

Tape on all sides is more than enough, there is very little force when it is all set up nicely. The Software \u00b6 I used Estlcam for this sticker. There are other vinyl cutting specific software but, Estlcam works well enough. I think the option for over cuts might be in Estlcam but the lead in works to prevent small tags keeping the part in from the blade offset. Open your dxf of choice and make sure the size is as expected. My grid is set at 25.4mm so this sticker will be about 3\u2033. Engrave would be the ideal path option for this but I want to use the lead in, so I set the tool diameter as small as permitted, 0.1mm. Select the path with either inside or outside tool. Use the \u201clead in\u201d button to get close to a path overlap. This makes sure the sticker has been completely cut out. I want this as an acid mask, so I chose to lead in from the inside of the design. Set the other path. Save the program, chose something small for the depth of cut. For this 0.2mm was used. Run the Gcode \u00b6 You can either load the .gcode into repetier host or save it to an SD card and run it from the LCD. Secure your vinyl/material to your cutting surface. I use painters tape on all sides and try to get the material to lay as flat and taught as possible. I use vinyl similar to this, http://amzn.to/2eHGbJU , I prefer medium tack for easy release.

This tool does exactly that, much cheaper (and more safely) than a laser. It\u2019s basically a very fast reciprocating needle \u2013 like a sewing machine \u2013 mounted on your CNC machine. Pin a sheet of foam board onto the bed of your CNC, load in the plane\u2019s gcode, set the origin, and start the machine. Twenty minutes or so later you have a sheet of parts that are accurately cut, easily punched out, and hot-glued together. Score cuts are no problem. You can build the cutter for about $20 , but you probably have some of the parts already. Description \u00b6 The needle is formed from a length of 0.5mm (0.025\u201d) music-wire and attached to a small ball-bearing mounted eccentrically on the flywheel. The flywheel is mounted on the shaft of a 2212 (stator size) brushless motor (with ESC and servo tester) and spun to create one stroke/perforation every revolution. The needle is guided by the nozzle from a MIG welder and helped to stay straight by guide bearings. It helps to sharpen the end of the needle by rotating it at 45 degrees to an abrasive wheel. Speeds \u00b6 The important number to remember is that you need 10-15 strokes/mm to cut cleanly and limit the load on the needle, i.e. feedrate (mm/min) of ONE-TENTH the cutter speed . At 8000-10000 rpm you can use a feed rate of 600-1000 mm/min to cleanly cut DollarTree foam board (paper on), blue-cor fanfold foam, etc. in about 20 minutes. At higher speeds, the MIG tip may heat up and melt the plastic mount, and the bending load on the needle can break it at the top. If your flywheel is poorly balanced and needs to run at lower speed, reduce the feedrate accordingly. Components \u00b6 A MPCNC can be built large enough to handle a 510x750mm (20\u201dx30\u201d) sheet of foam board, but it won\u2019t be stiff enough to mill aluminum. A LowRider can easily handle this size, is cheaper to build, and can be rolled aside when not in use to leave most of your bench for other work. There\u2019s also the ERC TimSav machine and moebeast\u2019s Foam Ripper , which are even cheaper and simpler, but harder to use for other things. Everyone uses fairly large motors, although the actual power used is very low, around 10-20W. This is largely historical, but it is useful to have a motor with a short shaft and threaded holes to bolt on the flywheel. To minimize vibration, you want the ecentric needle bearing fairly close to the motor bearing. Long shafts and collet adapters will require lower speeds. Motors of around 1000-1200kV work well. Faster motors need to run at very low throttle, where ESC and servo testers may have poor resolution, and the RPM may hunt or surge. The (3mm inside diameter) bearings can be harvested from broken motors, or a pack of 10 is about $2 on eBay. Washers must be small enough to not touch the outside (moving) part of the bearing. You can either start with smaller (M2.5) washers, super-glue them to some scrap wood and drill them out to 3mm, or start with 3mm washers, clamp them to a bolt and hold that in a cordless drill and run them against an abrasive wheel. There are various ways to attach the needle to the top bearing, but by far the easiest is the 3D printed collar in moebeast\u2019s Foam Ripper An alternative is to enclose the bearing in the flywheel, with a free-wheeling bolt. Attaching the needle to the bolt is much easier than to a smooth bearing. The Onshape model (for a 2822 motor) is public and can be accessed here . You will probably need to adjust it to get a good fit to your motor. More photos and a description are here Files \u00b6 There are two popular versions: ERC-MPCNC Needle Cutter jhitesma\u2019s Needle Cutter Here\u2019s a parametric CAD drawing of the second, which can be easily edited to suit different motors in the browser based OnShape (note that you can see and use other people\u2019s modifications): New cutter 525 mount Cutting procedure \u00b6 Place the material. Position the cutting head over the origin (front left corner of the board) Start the shop-vac. Start the cutter motor. Wind the Z-axis down until you can hear it just touch the surface. Select print file from the SD card. Vacuum hold down \u00b6 It is important that the foam board does not move during the cutting process. Pins and tape can work, but ideally you should have a fixed frame, into which the board fits. Foam board is also often bowed, and the cutter works best when it is flat (and score cuts require a predictable depth). The vacuum pad solves both problems. The vacuum pad consists of three sheets of DTFB (Dollar Tree Foam Board): two slotted sheets (glued together) with a loose \u201choles\u201d sheet that serves as the replaceable spoil board. The 3-layer stack sits on the work surface, with nothing between, and the vacuum pad not only pulls down the foam workpiece but also pulls itself down against the work surface. The shop-vac noise can be reduced with an inexpensive router speed control to reduce the speed. Use full power for a second to suck the work down, then reduce to minimum power. Here are DXF plans for the 3 sheet pad - although you need a working needle cutter to use them. It may be easier and faster to cut the first two with a craft knife and use the machine to make the grid of holes in the third sheet. Moebeast\u2019s Foam Ripper contains an STL for the manifold vacuum nozzle, or you can build a square funnel shape from foam board.

These are not assembled by me so a few extra minutes starting from scratch can save a lot of headaches in the end. Start by screwing the base plate to the stepper with the M3x6 screw. I prefer to have the wires oriented up. On the Tension arm add the bearing and broad headed screw. If the bearing does not spin freely, flip it over. One side is slightly offset. Make sure the bearing spins free and smoothly. Some sets include a washer, use it if you have it. Thread locker is a good idea as well. Add the tension arm and bolt. Make sure the arm swivels smoothly. If the arm binds you can loosen the screw a bit. Thread locker is a good idea here as well. Add the pulley next. Usually the set/grub screws are positioned closer to the motor but not always. Center the teeth on the idler pulley and make certain the pulley does not hit the heat sink that gets installed later. Tighten the set screw on the stepper\u2019s flat spot if it has one, the second screw. Double check the feed pulley to be sure the teeth are inline with the idler and the pulley does not hit the heat sink. Add the MicroSwiss throat and lock nut. This throat does not contain PTFE so it can handle higher temperatures and should not need any maintenance. To help with heat dissipation the lock nut is positioned on the inside of the bracket. Thread the throat is as far as it can go. Do not let the throat make contact with the idler or pulley. The smaller this gap the better soft and flexible filaments will print and the better the heat will dissipate from the throat when printing PLA slowly. Next up is the tension stack.

These are not assembled by me so a few extra minutes starting from scratch can save a lot of headaches in the end. Start by screwing the base plate to the stepper with the M3x6 screw. I prefer to have the wires oriented up. On the Tension arm add the bearing and broad headed screw. If the bearing does not spin freely, flip it over. One side is slightly offset. Make sure the bearing spins free and smoothly. Some sets include a washer, use it if you have it. Thread locker is a good idea as well. Add the tension arm and bolt. Make sure the arm swivels smoothly. If the arm binds you can loosen the screw a bit. Thread locker is a good idea here as well. Add the pulley next. Usually the set/grub screws are positioned closer to the motor but not always. Center the teeth on the idler pulley and make certain the pulley does not hit the heat sink that gets installed later.

So straight 2 color images with no gradients are best. Just plain old black and white. The higher the resolution the sharper the edges. Resize and adjust \u00b6 Next is open the image in Photoshop (or any image editor Paint.net is a free alternative), then resize it match the size you need. It is best to set the pixel resolution in your image editor as well. I use 100 px/cm or 0.1mm. I find the best quality with my setup at that resolution. Typically, a higher resolution is recommended but I had unsatisfactory results. While in your editor you can also adjust your levels to make the whites as white as possible and the blacks as black as possible. Image2GCode \u00b6 After you have your image sized and ready to go open up Image2GCode and load your image. The linked version has been modified for the Mostly Printed CNC. Remember you are engraving the backside of the mirror so you have to flip your image horizontally so it appears the correct way on the front of the mirror. If you do not, it will be backwards and you will need to start over. You can also Turn the gamma way down too this will help darken the blacks more if need be. You want the laser blasting as strongly as possible on the mirror. Next on the Laser profile tab you want to leave Min Power at 0 and change Max Power to 255 or select the Max radio button. No other changes required to the defaults here. On the last and final GCODE tab there are a few changes I make here. In the Gcode header section I add the following code: G0 X0 Y0 M201 X1000 Y1000 M204 P1000 T1000 This code turns up the default MPCNC acceleration. You may need to tweak these settings for your machine, these work well for mine. Your feedrate may vary slightly depending on the finish of the mirror. A good starting point would be 1200 mm/min. Click the Use S Param radio button. Type 106 S in the Laser Power on MCODE box and type M107 in the Laser Power Off MCODE box. I like to use diagonal scanning for best quality. You can choose to engrave an edge line if you like or not by selecting the check box. Click Generate file, give your file a name and the GCODE will be output.

These can and will blind and or burn you in less than 1/100 th of a second, It takes ten times that long to even react by blinking if it is in the visible spectrum. Did I make my point yet? Safety glasses are paramount. This is not the place to try and save money. You need a high quality pair and anyone else that could be around it needs the same quality. The cheaper your laser is the more money you will need to spend on the safety glasses. Import lasers are notorious for being dirty, mislabeled, and this makes them more dangerous. High quality lasers are of a known wavelength and strength therefore they are easy to protect yourself from, imports can contain other wavelengths that your goggles may or may not protect you from or be more powerful than your glasses are rated for. I am no expert, have no way of testing, and therefore no real say in who makes quality glasses, I cannot make a recommendation at this time. This video might help drive home the point. While we are on the subject, the laser looks extremely harmless in the goggles, kids (and most adults) will try to take off the glasses immediately so no youngsters (or tough guys) unless the laser is fully enclosed behind a laser shield and you trust them to listen. In the glasses the laser is just a bright dot but you can see in your periphery the entire room lights up. You never know when the laser could hit something slightly reflective, your mount could fail, the gcode could cram it into the surface and break your mount, your air assist could drop into and reflect the beam sending send a death beam in any direction. Lungs & Skin \u00b6 The other end of the safety spectrum is the material you are working with. You can\u2019t just go etching and cutting things willy nilly. Ever think you could make chlorine gas or cyanide in your own house\u2026.now you can. Laser cutting vinyl or ABS plastic does just that. Two extremely common materials. Here is the list I refer to most often, if you have a link to a better guide please let me know. Best practice is to contain all the laser smoke and direct it through a filter and vent it outside, at the very least vent it outside. You do not want to breath any of the smoke any modern man made material makes. Fire \u00b6 Now this one might be a little bit of a surprise to some and obvious to others. Lasers are burning your material, add air assist directly to the burn zone and strong ventilation fans and you end up with the best recipe for fire ever. Pay close attention never leave it unattended and have the appropriate type of fire suppression on hand. Fire is not extremely common on good cuts but if it does happen it happens stupid fast with all that force fed oxygen. Basics \u00b6 Types \u00b6 Two of the most common lasers in the maker world are CO2 and Diode lasers. Diode lasers are much more compact, have self-contained interchangeable optics, and are an order of magnitude lower power than a typical CO2 laser. More on the Power in a bit. These lasers operate at different wavelengths and this can have an effect of the type of material they are suitable for. Diode based lasers can range in price from a few dollars up to a few hundred, and CO2 based lasers start at a few hundred and go up from there. Both lasers have some sort of focal lens, but a CO2 laser also has a mirror system to steer the beam before focus. Diodes can be cooled with a small fan, CO2 use water and sometimes a chiller. Typically on any of the V1 Engineering machines you would be using a diode based laser. If your goal is to cut wood or plastic you should be looking at a CO2 laser. A Diode is best at marking/etching, and is only capable of cutting light materials (foam, paper, plastic) and very thin wood. Power \u00b6 Laser power, not as straight forward as you would think. Higher numbers in general mean thicker materials can be cut, or etching can be done faster. Numbers are not everything! A laser has four things to consider when talking about its power; wattage, spot size, focal length, spectrum. Wattage The overall power output of your laser (like a light bulb, energy per time). On most non-laser specific machines we are limited by speed. Okay stick with me, just like strapping on a chainsaw motor to the MPCNC stronger is not always better. Since we can only move so fast before we start to get motion degradation you need to size your laser accordingly. A strong laser moving slowly will have an extremely limited range of grey levels. For example at the same speed a higher powered laser will have to use power 1-20 so you don\u2019t start a fire (19 levels of grey), but a lower powered laser will be able to use power 1-255 (254 levels of grey) without starting a fire. Make sense? Spot size How small of a spot the wattage is concentrated on. Spot size dictates the resolution of the image you can produce, think printer DPI (dots per inch). Another side effect of spot size can be ability to cut. A poorly focused laser\u2019s power is too spread out to be effective, a finely focused laser cuts significantly better. For a diode this can vary 100-400 micron in diameter just by laser wattage. To be more clear, more powerful diode lasers cannot be focused to as small of a point as lower powered lasers (the source is not truly a point, larger diodes equal larger initial \u201cpoints\u201d, and it is not actually a spot but a rectangular spot). Focal length This influences the shape of the laser cone (long and narrow or short and fat). The focal length is dependent on the lens you use and should be a small range depending on the lens. If you have a choice; a longer focal length can aid in cutting ability (a thinner steeper beam/cone can cut deeper before power is lost to the edges of the material). Spectrum The wavelength of the light it produces (diodes-UV to viable, CO2- mid-infrared). Materials react differently to every spectrum as do safety glasses. If you have a specific need do your research before buying. Duty cycle One more thing on the topic of power, duty cycle or continuous time on. On the cheap import look out for sensational things like \u201c15W $50!\u201d somewhere in the description it could say \u201cOne second continuous operation time\u201d. This means they are over driving the heck out of the laser, it will not last long, and at 1 second bursts it is not very useful. Guard your wallet from these Scammy Chumps. I just found another ad that says no more than 30min continuous, that might sound like a lot at first but you can do some really detailed things that take a few hours. Air Assist \u00b6 To get cleaner etching, deeper cuts, and to save your lens you need some sort of air assist. While using your laser your material will produce smoke. This smoke if not directed away will stick to the material you are working with producing a sooty poor looking cut or etching. This smoke will also stick to the laser\u2019s lens and very quickly build up heat before you know it the lens will break. Bare minimum you need to have a 40mm fan clearing the area, even better are radial fans (higher pressure more direct), or even better yet a small compressor . If you have the ability to hook up your compressor and aim the air stream you can get significantly better cuts this way. Once again don\u2019t forget to vent your fumes safely and accordingly. The Hard Part \u00b6 Choosing \u00b6 Choosing which laser to buy can be the hardest part. If this all already seems overwhelming just buy a JTechPhotonics kit . Why; it is a trusted laser/company, glasses proven suitable for it, complete kits available, the only kit that is US legal , and the connections and use are as simple as it gets (more later). I think the 2W kits are a great deal. If you have other companies to suggest please let me know, and I will check them out. PWM, TTL, WTF? \u00b6 PWM, and TTL in this context are just how the power of the laser is controlled. All we really care about is if the laser is controlled by 5V or 12V. Good brands and companies make this abundantly clear, if you are buying an import this is by far the hardest part of the whole thing. The specs are not clear, the wiring diagrams are typically non-existent and if they are they can be wrong, we even have drivers with PCB\u2019s with misprinted polarity so you can\u2019t even follow that. Unfortunately import lasers, while super cheap, tend to be a guess and check game, both with connections and lens specs. With all common boards we can handle 12V and 5V signals, no big deal! 12V signal driven lasers are less common (Jtech). They are simple, you plug them into the print fan port (or any 12V port) on your control board and you are good to go. Using a 12V port you will typically use M106 SXXX to turn the laser on and M107 to turn the laser off. The Sxxx is the laser strength with a value between 0-255, 255 being the most power. 5V driven lasers need a firmware edit to assign the right pin for your board, this just reassigns the 12v fan pin to instead control a 5V pin. After that the same rules apply, use M106 SXXX to turn the laser on and M107 to turn the laser off. The Sxxx is the laser strength with a value between 0-255, 255 being the most power.

Focal length This influences the shape of the laser cone (long and narrow or short and fat). The focal length is dependent on the lens you use and should be a small range depending on the lens. If you have a choice; a longer focal length can aid in cutting ability (a thinner steeper beam/cone can cut deeper before power is lost to the edges of the material). Spectrum The wavelength of the light it produces (diodes-UV to viable, CO2- mid-infrared). Materials react differently to every spectrum as do safety glasses. If you have a specific need do your research before buying. Duty cycle One more thing on the topic of power, duty cycle or continuous time on. On the cheap import look out for sensational things like \u201c15W $50!\u201d somewhere in the description it could say \u201cOne second continuous operation time\u201d. This means they are over driving the heck out of the laser, it will not last long, and at 1 second bursts it is not very useful. Guard your wallet from these Scammy Chumps. I just found another ad that says no more than 30min continuous, that might sound like a lot at first but you can do some really detailed things that take a few hours.","title":"Power"},{"location":"tools/lasers/#air-assist","text":"To get cleaner etching, deeper cuts, and to save your lens you need some sort of air assist. While using your laser your material will produce smoke. This smoke if not directed away will stick to the material you are working with producing a sooty poor looking cut or etching. This smoke will also stick to the laser\u2019s lens and very quickly build up heat before you know it the lens will break. Bare minimum you need to have a 40mm fan clearing the area, even better are radial fans (higher pressure more direct), or even better yet a small compressor . If you have the ability to hook up your compressor and aim the air stream you can get significantly better cuts this way.

All we really care about is if the laser is controlled by 5V or 12V. Good brands and companies make this abundantly clear, if you are buying an import this is by far the hardest part of the whole thing. The specs are not clear, the wiring diagrams are typically non-existent and if they are they can be wrong, we even have drivers with PCB\u2019s with misprinted polarity so you can\u2019t even follow that. Unfortunately import lasers, while super cheap, tend to be a guess and check game, both with connections and lens specs. With all common boards we can handle 12V and 5V signals, no big deal! 12V signal driven lasers are less common (Jtech). They are simple, you plug them into the print fan port (or any 12V port) on your control board and you are good to go. Using a 12V port you will typically use M106 SXXX to turn the laser on and M107 to turn the laser off. The Sxxx is the laser strength with a value between 0-255, 255 being the most power. 5V driven lasers need a firmware edit to assign the right pin for your board, this just reassigns the 12v fan pin to instead control a 5V pin. After that the same rules apply, use M106 SXXX to turn the laser on and M107 to turn the laser off. The Sxxx is the laser strength with a value between 0-255, 255 being the most power.

This subject can get very deep and intimidating so I will try and present this in a tiered manner. Improving as we learn collectively and as the software (CAM) improves. I am no expert. I learn by reading and trial and error. Test cuts speak volumes and should be considered a requirement. You should have test cuts that are small but representative of your part. If you are doing a 3D sculpt isolate a small part and mill it out, if you are cutting out a part with a pocket and some holes make a small part with a pocket and a hole. These test cuts can save hours on the actual job, every time you do one I promise you will learn something. Baby Steps \u00b6 You should have already done some plotting, as shown here . You should have a very clean drawing if you don\u2019t you should not be milling yet. Make sure the pen picks up all the way (clearance plane), and the parts are the right size. This ensure your machine works correctly and you are familiar with the basics of CAM and how your machine moves. After plotting the next step in milling would be HD foam , (I find it at the big box store \u201cfoamular\u201d $5 for a \u00bc sheet), this material holds amazing tolerances, mills very well, and will not destroy your machine when you make a mistake. If you are new this should always be the material you make a first test cut in, then on to test cuts in the material you want to use. You can make test cuts on both sides and the $5 it costs will pay for itself many times over in saved bits and refined CAM settings (time & accuracy). Some of the first cuts ever made on an MPCNC. For The Impatient \u00b6 If you just want to get the machine dirty here is the generic recipe. This should work in every material; you can optimize later. Single flute \u215b\u2033 upcut bit . 8mm/s Feed Rate (The speed at which you move through the material). 3mm/s Plunge Rate (The speed at which you move vertically into the material). 1mm Depth of Cut (The thickness of material your bit will be removing per pass). 45% Step Over (The percentage of bit diameter that should be in contact with the material) Use the Peel pocketing strategy. Always use a finishing pass of \u224810% of your tools diameter. The denser the material the smaller the finishing pass. At this point you should be in HD foam, if that works out you can try some soft wood like pine. If that works at this point the only variable you should be changing is the depth of cut . You can vary this and it will increase the load on your machine in trade for more material removed per pass or decrease the load by taking shallower bites. Peel, Is usually the best pocketing strategy. When you get that out of your system come back and learn things a little more in depth. A More Proper Introduction \u00b6 These are some of the first things you should understand when just getting started. I am going to collect and link all the great resources I think illustrate the point the best. Most of these pictures should link to an outside site for more information. If you disagree with any of the following information please let me know\u2026politely. Islands \u00b6 An island is that pesky little thing in the center of a cut, like the middle on an \u201cO\u201d, or the center of the logo. Super easy only takes 3 steps. Using the Part tool select the inner feature. Next is the Hole tool, select the outer feature. Then in the Properties box select Island . Work offsets \u00b6 A work offset is simply moving your origin. This is typically used when there are more than one operation in your job, multiple fixtures can be used, locating pins, or other locating methods. More typically for us to avoid Negative X and Y moves when using endstops. Not Offset Offset (Good for Dual Endstops) Finishing Pass \u00b6 A finishing pass allows you to complete your job faster with more accuracy. What?! By leaving a bit of material on your roughing cut you can then cut off a very small amount of material leaving you with a very accurate final cut with a better surface finish. This means you can rough out your part faster (high machine loads increase deflection) and the finishing skim cut (extremely low machine loads) will bring it to final dimension. All cuts should have this, most importantly slotting operations. Just select your finishing tool, usually the current tool you are using. Shown in the yellow box. Use a 5-25% tool diameter allowance. Shown in the yellow box. The finishing pass is show in the picture as the lighter red path. Climb vs. Conventional Milling \u00b6 For the most part you always want to Climb mill. The edge of the cutter starts with a large bite and ends small, reducing work hardening and heat retention. Conventional milling Climb milling Feeds and Speeds Calculator \u00b6 I cannot stress this enough; these numbers are different for every build. Only use them as a guide to find the right settings for your build. You can make a few test cuts a quickly work out how to get reliable numbers for your machine with the right settings though. https://fswizard.com/www/ Stepover \u00b6 Basic All things being equal, this is the amount of material your tool encounters in percentage of the tool diameter. The lower the percentage the lower the force on the machine, the more accurate the cut. Expanded A good thing to know is most flutes are not 50% of the diameter of the bit, usually less. Just typing in a percentage does not mean that is the actual chip load, Feed rate, RPM, and Depth of Cut all play a major part. All the numbers you enter are a fine balance of an equation giving you total chip load per tooth. Roughing is 50% or less, typically 45% depending on material density. More than 50% you will be both climb and conventional milling and should be avoided. Finishing is 20% or less depending on amount if detail and tolerances desired (I typically use 2-8% time vs. quality), ball endmills should use 10% or less to minimize scalloping. 50% stepover 25% stepover Dual EndStop Tool Changes, Z Probing \u00b6 For this method you will need the Dual EndStop firmware, an LCD, optionally a digital spindle speed controller. Starting Gcode \u00b6 The pause here is to allow you to remove the Z probe wires. G91 ; Relative positioning, just in case G92 X0 Y0 Z0 ; Set Current position to 0, all axes G00 Z5.0000 F500 ; Raise Z 5mm at 8.3mm/s to clear clamps and screws G28 X Y Z ; Home in order, w/zprobe G92 Z0.5 ; Account for probe thickness (set your thickness) G00 Z5.000 F500 ; Raise Z probe off of surface M00 ; pause for LCD button press M03 S<s> ; PID, set spindle speed G90 ; Absolute positioning, just in case Tool Change \u00b6 The steppers are disabled so you can move the head to an area where you can more easily change the tool, make sure you do not let your Z axis drop onto your work surface. If you need you can insert another pause before the steppers are disabled to make sure you are there to catch it. This first pause is to let you physically change the tool and install the Z probe. The second pause is to allow you to remove the Z probe. M05 ; PID, Stop spindle G0 Z35 F500 ; Raise Z axis 35mm M84 ; Disable steppers M00 ; Wait for LCD button press ;Change tool: <n> G28 X Y Z ; Home in order, w/zprobe G92 Z0.15 ; Account for probe thickness (set your thickness) G00 Z5.0000 F500 ; Raise Z probe off of surface M00 ; pause for LCD button press M03 S<s> ; PID, set spindle speed Ending \u00b6 Make sure you tune the final Z lift to your machine. M05 ; PID, Turn off spindle G0 Z30 ; Lift Z axis 30mm ; M84 ; Optionally turn off steppers. If you do not have a PID controller you do not have to remove or worry about the code. This is the basics, you can easily modify this. Depth of Cut \u00b6 Equal steps \u2013 Depth of cut, DOC, Should be planned for. Making equal steps will produce the best results. Just because you can cut deeper doesn\u2019t mean you should. Know the deepest you can cut your material and from there divide the cut equally. The only way to save time is less passes, if you can not save a pass make the step smaller. Equal Steps Pointless Steps Through all \u2013 Through all cuts, cuts that are intended to go all the way through the material, should move past the bottom of your material. The amount past depends on the flatness of your build, all build have some sort of variance. A 0.5mm-4mm would be pretty typical. Factor this into your equal DOC from above. Through All Post Processors \u00b6 When making Gcode from your CAM program it spits out raw coordinates, speeds, and a few other commands. A post processor simply formats in a way that your firmware will recognize it. For example, Marlin treat G0 (rapid move) and G1 (Work move) the same. Other machines set the G0 speed in the firmware, Marlin does not. To overcome this we Use a line in the post processor to set the actual speed in each line so it doesn\u2019t matter. There are all sorts of things like this. All machines require a post processor. The ones we have working \u00b6 Please share your links to other PP\u2019s. I know there are more. Estlcam \u00b6 Built in, Christian was happy to work with us to get this correct. Here are the recommended settings Fusion360: \u00b6 Warning Fusion\u2019s free plan no longer supports more than one speed, so the feedrate for XY turn into very fast Z movements.

The stiffness of the design is adequate and low horsepower routers and spindles work fine. Nothing extra is really required for cutting metals but the best upgrade would really be a variable speed router to provide a larger window to dial in feeds and speeds and perhaps an air blast system for cooling and clearing chips. Don\u2019t be afraid to experiment! This article is only intended to get others started and understand how to troubleshoot problems. Think about the chips and look at them when making changes. If you want to go deeper in the subject use a good feeds and speeds calculator and read on-line articles specific to each number or setting in calculator. Chips are the goal \u00b6 Milling is dependent on the ability of the tool to make a chip as it rotates. Say you are cutting a relatively hard material like steel with a \u00bd\u201d endmill and the cut you need to make is a slot. The mill is going to be surrounded 180 degrees by material as it moves forward. It has a generous \u00bd turn to make the chip and you would probably not feed the tool into the material very quickly. For this scenario, you would not need very many RPM\u2019s on you spindle (speed), the feed rate would be rather slow and the MRR (Material Removal Rate) could be quite high depending on depth. It would require a decent amount of HP and torque along with cooling fluid. You would need a very stiff and heavy machine to do this. So how do we adopt this process to a lightweight, high RPM, low HP, home built machine? Each cutting parameter must be tuned for the machine. Speeds (RPM) \u00b6 The first adjustment in moving from a conventional heavy mill to a router-based gantry mill is RPM. Let\u2019s assume the worst case in using a DeWalt DW660 or similar with no speed control. In essence, the speed portion of the MPCNC speeds and feeds is already set. When a router is spinning at 30,000 RPM there is an extremely small amount of time to make a chip as the cutter blade enters and exits the material. To adjust for this, simply enough, a router-based mill is set up to make smaller chips. Make Smaller Chips \u00b6 There are essentially 3 ways to reduce the chip size to the point of being in the speed zone of a router. Reduce the tool diameter \u00b6 SFM (surface feet per minute) (surface feet per minute) is the speed of the cutter in relation to the part. SFM is directly related to the spindle RPM by the equation SFM=RPM X Circumference of the cutter. Tool manufacturers provide a recommended SFM based tooling geometry and type of material being cut. The harder the material being cut, the slower the SFM required. Mild steel requires roughly half the SFM as aluminum. This is an important point because moving from wood, to aluminum, to mild steel requires either slower and slower spindle speeds or smaller and smaller cutters. Luckily \u215b\u201d diameter endmills can get close to the correct SFM for many metals. Decrease the number of flutes \u00b6 When cutting a slot an endmill is going to be surrounded 180 degrees by material as it moves forward. With 2 flutes you only need \u00bd the time as a single flute to generate the same chip and so on. Therefore, the more flutes you have, the faster your RPM and feeds must be to make the same sized full chip. More flutes = require higher RPM\u2019s, more machine rigidity, and faster cutting speeds. That sounds like a really cool way to jack up your productivity until you understand the practical limitations, machine rigidity, chip clearing, and feedrate. For each flute on the cutter the machine will be engaged in the material. Two flutes equal nearly two times the load on the machine of a single flute cutter. For each flute on an equal sized cutter there is a smaller path for the chip to get ejected. The practical limit of travel speed for a standard MPCNC build is around 1800 mm/min. If we can\u2019t feed faster than that, clear the flutes, or resist the cutting load, than more flutes will not help us. Limit the cut width \u00b6 Chip load relates the thickness of a chip removed by each cutting edge. This is parameter is specific to the tool and the material being used. You can have to small and too large of a chip. For each revolution a single flute end mill needs to cut and discharge a single chip. I referenced the worst case in cutting a full slot with 100% cut width, but if we avoid making a slot and only use 15% of the tool diameter for cutting, then we have even less time to generate that full chip and more RPM is needed. Therefor by using a small diameter cutting tool with a small number of flutes and limiting the cut width, we can cut metal at an RPM attainable by a fixed RPM router and within the working parameters of the MPCNC. That is the \u201csweet spot\u201d. Limiting the amount of material that the cutter engages with does a couple of things. You are not only able to match the router RPM to get that full chip, but it also reduces the load on the tool and machine. Another benefit is relatively fast feed rates, deeper cuts, and better cooling. Even for large industrial machines there is an optimum RPM, cut width, and feed rate that allows the largest MRR, which is what really matters. Climb milling is preferred over conventional when using this strategy. Feed Rates \u00b6 Once a proper end mill is selected in terms of number of flutes and cut width is determined, the next big challenge is feed rates. High RPM usually means high feed. By limiting the cut width on a \u215b\u201d endmill you can achieve incredibly fast feed rates of 3000mm/min or more! This is the basis for high-speed machining (HSM). However, the MPCNC is limited on feed rates to about 1800 mm/min and has a certain amount of deflection in the rails. So, the challenge is to cut materials at a feed rate that is appropriate for the machine and above the point of chip thinning. Chip thinning Chip thinning as it sounds is a condition where you are not making a full chip anymore. As the chip gets thinner, less heat is removed from the cut and overheating occurs because the tool is rubbing the material instead of cutting it. This will limit tool life. Bottom line, we want feed rates to be as fast as we can go without overloading the tool, the machine, while still getting a proper sized chip. Going very slow to ease your way through will not work. To summarize thus far, end mills can be programmed to run with a limited cut width in a high RPM router to make proper size chips and cut metals adequately. There are other factors we still must deal with. The next issue is deflection, and it not only limits the feed rate we can move but also the cut depth. I will separate this into 2 separate topics, tool deflection and machine deflection. Tool Deflection \u00b6 Tool deflection is the tool sticking out of the spindle flexing and bending as it comes into contact with the wall. This can and will break tools. Normally the simplest way to compensate is use a bigger diameter cutter. If you have a variable speed router you have some options here but if you only have 25-30,000 RPMs to work with you are probably stuck with a \u215b\u201d diameter cutter. If you think you are breaking tools due to tool deflection, there are a few things you can change to solve this issue and they are not too difficult. Tool made of carbide \u2013 much stiffer material, this is the least you will need to do to cut metal. Smaller cut length \u2013 purchase tools with shorter flutes, not longer. Reduce stick out \u2013 push the tool as deep into the collet as you can to run at the depth you need. Mount the tool with only the flutes exposed and a very small amount of the stem sticking out of the collet. Avoid long reach end mills. Tool coatings \u2013 Tool coatings have multiple benefits including increasing stiffness and extending life. AlTin \u2013 Highest temp resistance, good for dry machining of tough alloys such as titanium, Inconel, and stainless steel. TiCN \u2013 Better than TiN and often used for stainless steel, cast iron, and harder steels TiN \u2013 General purpose for mild steel, stainless steel, and Inconel ZrN \u2013 Resists gumming of sticky materials. Best choice for nonferrous materials such as aluminum and plastics. Machine Deflection \u00b6 Next up is machine deflection. This the most difficult variable to quantify. Smaller machines will be more rigid than larger machines. If you intend on cutting metal you should limit the bed size as small as possible and only increase it as you gain experience. First of all, before you run any program in metal, make sure your CNC mill is tight. For the MPCNC, check all of the bearings to make sure that they are touching a metal tube. No free spinning bearings that do not touch the rails. No exceptions. Then lock the motors in, grab the core, and try to move it around. Look for any movement and try to determine where it is coming from. If your machine is not tight, cutting metal will be a very frustrating experience. Watch it closely as it runs. If you see a cut start to deteriorate, it is most likely the machine loosening up or a tool that is dull. Sadly enough, the machine loosening up will cause the tool to dull. If things do start to loosen up over time, best practice is to reinstall the fastener with Loctite but do not over tighten. Follow the original assembly instructions . Cranking up the torque on the screws creates more stress in the PLA which in turn causes more creep or relaxation in the material, and this is accelerated by the surrounding temperature in the environment. Proper torque on the bolts and screws is better than tighter. Depth of Cut \u00b6 If you have the right tool, proper cut width, and reasonable feed rates that all match the router RPM, then the only limitation to go deeper and deeper is machine rigidity. Deeper cuts are actually better for the process. The more material in contact with the flutes spreads the force of cutting into more of the tool. This increases tool life. If you only cut at \u00bdmm depth, the very tip of the tool must do all of the work and will dull in a much shorter time while the rest of the tool is still sharp. But on the contrary, the deeper the cut the more force is imparted on the tool and into the machine causing deflection. This can only be dialed in with trials and experiments. If you go conservative with 1 or 2 mm cuts, you will go through tools faster, and if you cut at 6, 7, or even 8mm depth, you may exceed the deflection of the machine and possibly the tool. Once your CNC is pushing the maximum feedrate, increasing depth becomes the best opportunity for increasing your MRR while maintaining a proper chip size.

You may be able to cut a little deeper if you slow down the feed rate. Sure, as long as you don\u2019t go too slow. You may be able to speed up the feed rate by selecting a tool with more flutes. Sure, if you don\u2019t exceed the feed rate or rigidity of the machine. And on and on. Speed and Feed calculators are a great way to play around with different settings to see what changes. Here is a diagram that shows some of the intermingled relationships. Of course, there is more to think about. These were some of the basic settings that effect your MRR. Advanced Topics \u00b6 Runout \u00b6 Runout is how far off center your cutting edge is on your tool. Nothing is perfect so any and typically all of the spinning components add to the total runout, motor bearings, shaft, collet, and tool. Low runout is critical for high-speed milling with small cutters. The tool will get loaded heavier in the area of runout which will affect the chip load. Imagine a 2 flute endmill with a small chip made on 1 flute and a large chip made on the other while you are trying to set your machine to a nominal value. For a router there can be runout in the spindle and in the collet. Check both. Use a dial indicator with a base. A loose tool can deform the collet so check it maybe every 10 run hours or anytime a tool falls out. If the collet has excess runout replace it. Check for any debris that may be causing a problem. Poor or worn bearings can cause runout in the spindle. You may need to replace the bearings or choose another router. You should try to limit the total combined runout to below 0.001\u201d. That is really small and difficult to measure without a quality gauge. Once you cannot reduce the runout anymore be aware you may need to reduce the cut width more to compensate for the maximum runout value. Tool Quality \u00b6 Buy the best tools you can afford. Each step up gives increased advantage. At the lowest level are high speed steel endmills. For a quick one-off job in aluminum, you might get away with it, but you will need to go really easy. As a minimum you should step up to a carbide tool. It will last longer and resist deflection much better. Carbide tools are a must for mild carbon steel. The next step up is a coating. Use TiN or better for steel and aluminum. It increases hardness and tool life. Even better for aluminum is ZrN. This coating not only has increased hardness but resists gumming up. It will allow you to use a 2 or 3-flute endmill and run faster feed rates. Chip clearing \u00b6 This is very important especially in aluminum. You must keep the chips clear of the cutting tool. This is easy enough when pocketing or face milling but gets much more difficult when doing a trochoidal slot. The deeper you cut, the more difficult it is to clear them. There are various ways to deal with this. The most common is a compressed air jet either manual or continuous flow. Other techniques include vacuum attachments, or if slotting all the way through the part, leaving a gap on the back side for the chips to fall. If nothing else, you can just limit the cutting depth, but that reduces MRR and adds time to the process. Cooling \u00b6 A full flush cooling system is a little impractical for the MPCNC but could be done. If you really run a lot of metal in your machine it might something to consider. You can lubricate aluminum with a mist. It will reduce the tendency of aluminum to gum up. A misting system can be built easily for less than $50 plus the cost of small air compressor. A spray bottle also works if you monitor the cutting. You can use various fluids including water-based machining lubricants or light oils. A lubricant mist helps but is not required for steel and it cuts rather well dry. Here is a simple diagram of a misting system. It floods the area with tiny droplets but does not atomize the fluid into a fog you can breathe. You can find more details and specific instructions with a Google search. Surface finish \u00b6 If you need a better surface finish, that usually means taking a final thin pass of 0.2-0.3mm and slowing the feed rate down, a \u201cFinishing pass\u201d or \u201cSpring pass\u201d. You may also reduce the cut width. If your surface finish is deteriorating while you cut, you will need to troubleshoot the cause. Programming (CAM) for Metals \u00b6 The final piece of the puzzle is programming your machine\u2019s g-code in a way that minimizes tool loads and power. This is where all of the many factors previously described need to be addressed. Some CAM software packages do this much better than others. You may not need to incorporate all of these strategies depending on the robustness of your machine but by using them you guarantee low consistent tool loads and no surprises. These become much more important when cutting ferrous metals like steel. Avoid plunging a MPCNC into metal. Always use a helical spiral when entering the metal from the top. Endmills do not drill very well to start with, but if you do need to drill metal with an endmill, you must go slowly. Another idea for smaller diameter holes is just center mark the location of the hole with your CAM program and complete the drilling on a drill press. For starts and stops you may need to drill access holes with a drill press. If you must plunge, limit the z speed and depth of plunge as much as possible. You can deflect the rails enough to lift a router by plunging too fast. Only use milling strategies that avoid loading the tool beyond the cut width you desire. A Trochoidal (or adaptive) tool path is great for this. It avoids excess tool loads by limiting cut width and by moving away from the cut on each tiny circle it cools the tool even more. It is the best programming strategy for making slots, but it can be slow due to a large percentage of the machine movement is not productive. A \u215b\u201d diameter endmill with 50% Trochoidal width and 8% stepover will only advance at 5% of the feed rate. For this reason, you should be able to run most Trochoidal cuts at the maximum feed rate of the MPCNC. Peeling is another good strategy you can use to minimize tool engagement. Just be careful where you enter and exit the material and the corners. When changing directions in a corner some programs will push the tool into a 180-degree cut width. You may need to cut a clearance area or \u201coversize\u201d the tool path to avoid the wall turn. Experiment with different strategies. A trochoidal outline for clearance, peeling a pocket, and trochoidal pockets can all be combined. Test your strategies with wood or other soft material. This is very important if you are unsure of how the tool will move. Baseline Settings \u00b6 Now for the good stuff. Even if you do not fully understand this article you can use the following chart as a starting point. It is based on using coated solid carbide \u215b\u201d diameter endmills 1-\u00bc\u201d long, \u00bc\u201d length of cut, running at 30,000 RPM. For mild steel, toolpaths must limit the tool engagement no more that the cut width recommended. Always experiment with wood if unsure of toolpaths. When running trials, start with the lower side of the cut width range and dial up the feed rates as you go. Then experiment with cut width and depth to find your own sweet spot. Material Tool Diameter\\n(in) Flutes RPM Feedrate Range\\n(mm/min) Cut Width Range % of diameter Starting Depth Note Aluminum 0.125 1 30000 300-800 8.9-14% 3 Mist Cooling Aluminum 0.125 2 30000 850-Max 8.9-14% 3 Mist Cooling Low Carbon Steel 0.125 2 30000 900-Max 4.7-5.7% 1.5 Low Carbon Steel 0.125 3 30000 1300-Max 4.7-5.7% 1.5 Speed and Feed calculators are available to dial in other options such as variable speed routers, larger diameter tools, different materials, etc. I highly suggest using one so you can see how each parameter can interact with others. I don\u2019t know how far you can push the envelope with your MPCNC, but other router-based mills have run stainless steels, Inconel, and titanium with proper set up and high-quality tooling.","title":"Milling Metal"},{"location":"tools/milling-metal/#milling-metal","text":"By Clark Stephens (@clarkspeed in the forums) Forum discussion","title":"Milling Metal"},{"location":"tools/milling-metal/#summary","text":"If you keep the machine small, and follow the practices outlined below, the MPCNC is capable out of the box for light duty cutting of metals.

For this scenario, you would not need very many RPM\u2019s on you spindle (speed), the feed rate would be rather slow and the MRR (Material Removal Rate) could be quite high depending on depth. It would require a decent amount of HP and torque along with cooling fluid. You would need a very stiff and heavy machine to do this.

You can use various fluids including water-based machining lubricants or light oils. A lubricant mist helps but is not required for steel and it cuts rather well dry. Here is a simple diagram of a misting system. It floods the area with tiny droplets but does not atomize the fluid into a fog you can breathe. You can find more details and specific instructions with a Google search.","title":"Cooling"},{"location":"tools/milling-metal/#surface-finish","text":"If you need a better surface finish, that usually means taking a final thin pass of 0.2-0.3mm and slowing the feed rate down, a \u201cFinishing pass\u201d or \u201cSpring pass\u201d. You may also reduce the cut width. If your surface finish is deteriorating while you cut, you will need to troubleshoot the cause.","title":"Surface finish"},{"location":"tools/milling-metal/#programming-cam-for-metals","text":"The final piece of the puzzle is programming your machine\u2019s g-code in a way that minimizes tool loads and power. This is where all of the many factors previously described need to be addressed. Some CAM software packages do this much better than others. You may not need to incorporate all of these strategies depending on the robustness of your machine but by using them you guarantee low consistent tool loads and no surprises. These become much more important when cutting ferrous metals like steel. Avoid plunging a MPCNC into metal. Always use a helical spiral when entering the metal from the top. Endmills do not drill very well to start with, but if you do need to drill metal with an endmill, you must go slowly. Another idea for smaller diameter holes is just center mark the location of the hole with your CAM program and complete the drilling on a drill press. For starts and stops you may need to drill access holes with a drill press. If you must plunge, limit the z speed and depth of plunge as much as possible. You can deflect the rails enough to lift a router by plunging too fast. Only use milling strategies that avoid loading the tool beyond the cut width you desire. A Trochoidal (or adaptive) tool path is great for this. It avoids excess tool loads by limiting cut width and by moving away from the cut on each tiny circle it cools the tool even more. It is the best programming strategy for making slots, but it can be slow due to a large percentage of the machine movement is not productive. A \u215b\u201d diameter endmill with 50% Trochoidal width and 8% stepover will only advance at 5% of the feed rate. For this reason, you should be able to run most Trochoidal cuts at the maximum feed rate of the MPCNC. Peeling is another good strategy you can use to minimize tool engagement. Just be careful where you enter and exit the material and the corners. When changing directions in a corner some programs will push the tool into a 180-degree cut width. You may need to cut a clearance area or \u201coversize\u201d the tool path to avoid the wall turn. Experiment with different strategies. A trochoidal outline for clearance, peeling a pocket, and trochoidal pockets can all be combined. Test your strategies with wood or other soft material. This is very important if you are unsure of how the tool will move.","title":"Programming (CAM) for Metals"},{"location":"tools/milling-metal/#baseline-settings","text":"Now for the good stuff. Even if you do not fully understand this article you can use the following chart as a starting point. It is based on using coated solid carbide \u215b\u201d diameter endmills 1-\u00bc\u201d long, \u00bc\u201d length of cut, running at 30,000 RPM. For mild steel, toolpaths must limit the tool engagement no more that the cut width recommended. Always experiment with wood if unsure of toolpaths. When running trials, start with the lower side of the cut width range and dial up the feed rates as you go. Then experiment with cut width and depth to find your own sweet spot. Material Tool Diameter\\n(in) Flutes RPM Feedrate Range\\n(mm/min) Cut Width Range % of diameter Starting Depth Note Aluminum 0.125 1 30000 300-800 8.9-14% 3 Mist Cooling Aluminum 0.125 2 30000 850-Max 8.9-14% 3 Mist Cooling Low Carbon Steel 0.125 2 30000 900-Max 4.7-5.7% 1.5 Low Carbon Steel 0.125 3 30000 1300-Max 4.7-5.7% 1.5 Speed and Feed calculators are available to dial in other options such as variable speed routers, larger diameter tools, different materials, etc. I highly suggest using one so you can see how each parameter can interact with others. I don\u2019t know how far you can push the envelope with your MPCNC, but other router-based mills have run stainless steels, Inconel, and titanium with proper set up and high-quality tooling.","title":"Baseline Settings"},{"location":"zenxy/","text":"ZenXY v2 \u00b6 Inspired by the awesome Sisyphus Table by Bruce Shapiro, http://www.sisyphus-industries.com/ , Zen gardens that my mom loves, and the crazy CoreXY belting system.
